I dodged his claws and managed to smack him in the
snout with the flat of my blade, but that barely fazed him.
Leroy backed up and charged again, slavering, baring his
fangs. I slashed at his neck, but Leroy was too smart. He
darted to the left and sank his teeth into my free arm. If it
hadn’t been for my makeshift leather armguard, I would’ve
been minus one arm. As it was, Leroy’s fangs still bit clear
through the leather. Red-hot pain shot up my arm.
I yelled, and a primal surge of power coursed through my
body. I felt myself rising off the ground and the golden aura of
the hawk warrior forming around me. The Set animal’s jaws
were pried open so fast that it yelped and let go of my arm. I
stood, now encased in a magical barrier twice my normal size,
and kicked Leroy into the wall.
Good! said Horus. Now dispatch the beast to the
netherworld!
Quiet, man. I’m doing all the work.
I was vaguely aware of security guards trying to regroup,
yelling into their walkie-talkies and calling for help. Travelers
were still screaming and running around. I heard a little girl
shout: “Chicken man, get the moose!”
You know how hard it is to feel like an extreme falconheaded combat machine when somebody calls you “chicken
man”?
