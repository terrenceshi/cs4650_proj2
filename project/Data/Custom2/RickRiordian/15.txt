Ares bared his teeth, but I'd seen his threatening look before on Clarisse. There was
something false about it, almost like he was nervous.
"You're lucky you met me, punk, and not one of the other Olympians. They're not as
forgiving of rudeness as I am. I'll meet you back here when you're done. Don't disappoint me."
After that I must have fainted, or fallen into a trance, because when I opened my eyes again,
Ares was gone. I might've thought the conversation had been a dream, but Annabeth and Grover's
expressions told me otherwise.
"Not good," Grover said. "Ares sought you out, Percy. This is not good."
I stared out the window. The motorcycle had disappeared.
Did Ares really know something about my mom, or was he just playing with me? Now that
he was gone, all the anger had drained out of me. I realized Ares must love to mess with people's
emotions. That was his powerâ€”cranking up the passions so badly, they clouded your ability to
think.
"It's probably some kind of trick," I said. "Forget Ares. Let's just go."
"We can't," Annabeth said. "Look, I hate Ares as much as anybody, but you don't ignore the
gods unless you want serious bad fortune. He wasn't kidding about turning you into a rodent."
I looked down at my cheeseburger, which suddenly didn't seem so appetizing. "Why does he
need us?"
"Maybe it's a problem that requires brains," Annabeth said. "Ares has strength. That's all he
has. Even strength has to bow to wisdom sometimes."
