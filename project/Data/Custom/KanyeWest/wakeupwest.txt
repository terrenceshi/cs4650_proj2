I knew I was gonna see ya, I knew I was gonna see you again!
I was gonna see you again
Where your god damn book bag at?
Always carryin' that lil' book bag
Nobody want to see that
God damn fourth grader
Sit yo' ass down
Now he want to play it again like he got something else to do
You ain't got nothin' else to do
You ain't doing nothing wit yo life
Nothing with your life
What do you think this is?
You better look at me when I'm talkin' to you!
You think this is easy don't you?
You think this is promised
Oh ain't nothin promised with you
Look at my face, do I got a promise face?
Does it look like promise you anything?
Kanye!
Nigga! Is you snorin' in my class?
Wake up Mr. West! Mr. West
