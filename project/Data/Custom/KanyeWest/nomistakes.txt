Believe it or not
Believe it or not
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Take the top off, let the sun come in (on you)
Woah, for all my dogs that stay down, we up again (yeah)
Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard
I had dead on my books, it's been a shaky ass year
Let me make this clear, so all y'all see
I don't take advice from people less successful than me, huh?
Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off
And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
Had to tell the dogs "turn the snuffs off"
Plus they already mad that the Cubs lost
(Believe it or not)
These two wrongs'll right you
(Believe it or not)
I was too grown in high school
(Believe it or not)
The true soul of Ice Cube
Too close to snipe you
Truth told, I like you
Too bold to type you
Too rich to fight you
Calm down, you light skin!
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (make no)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (ooh wee)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (ooh wee)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
