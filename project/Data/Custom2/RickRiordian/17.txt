The whole lobby was a giant game room. And I'm not talking about cheesy old Pac-Man
games or slot machines. There was an indoor waterslide snaking around the glass elevator, which
went straight up at least forty floors. There was a climbing wall on the side of one building, and
an indoor bungee-jumping bridge. There were virtual-reality suits with working laser guns. And
hundreds of video games, each one the size of a widescreen TV. Basically, you name it, this place
had it. There were a few other kids playing, but not that many. No waiting for any of the games.
There were waitresses and snack bars all around, serving every kind of food you can imagine.
"Hey!" a bellhop said. At least I guessed he was a bellhop. He wore a white-and-yellow
Hawaiian shirt with lotus designs, shorts, and flip-flops. "Welcome to the Lotus Casino. Here's
your room key."
I stammered, "Um, but..."
"No, no," he said, laughing. "The bill's taken care of. No extra charges, no tips. Just go on up
to the top floor, loom 4001. If you need anything, like extra bubbles for the hot tub, or skeet
targets for the shooting range, or whatever, just call the front desk. Here are your LotusCash
cards. They work in the restaurants and on all the games and rides."
He handed us each a green plastic credit card.
I knew there must be some mistake. Obviously he thought we were some millionaire's kids.
But I took the card and said, "How much is on here?"
His eyebrows knit together. "What do you mean?"
