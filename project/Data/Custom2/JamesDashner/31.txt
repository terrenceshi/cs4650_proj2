Two hours later, they still hadn’t seen a single door.
The ghost wind had own by three more times, that disturbing
whispered phrase following from everywhere at once. It sent chills
across Michael’s skin on each pass, but he tried his best not to show

it did nothing to harm them. And as they walked down the neverending hallway, Michael’s concern shifted from the haunting visitor

would sap the strength out of their Auras until they only had
enough energy to crawl
