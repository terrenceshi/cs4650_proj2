Lookin’ at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin’ at my wrist it’ll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine sippin’ Rose all along
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot excess is just my character
All black tux nigga the shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbin’ up the Lord’s ladder
We still speedin’ runnin’ signs like they don’t matter
Uh hater talkin’ never made me mad
Never that when I’m in my favorite papertag
Therefore G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I’m a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin’ so it’s on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan they’ll export
So many cars DMV though it was mail fraud
Different traps I was gettin’ mail from
Polk County Jacksonville rep Melbourne
Whole clique’s appetite had tapeworms
Spinnin’ Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns
I shed a tear before the nights over
God bless the man I put this ice over
Gettin’ 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga red Coogi sweater dice roller
I’m makin’ love to the angel of death
Catchin’ feelings never stumble retracin’ my steps
