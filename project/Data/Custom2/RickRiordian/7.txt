I thought about some of the kids I'd seen in the Hermes cabin, teenagers who looked sullen
and depressed, as if they were waiting for a call that would never come. I'd known kids like that
at Yancy Academy, shuffled off to boarding school by rich parents who didn't have the time to
deal with them. But gods should behave better.
"So I'm stuck here," I said. "That's it? For the rest of my life?"
"It depends," Annabeth said. "Some campers only stay the summer. If you're a child of
Aphrodite or Demeter, you're probably not a real powerful force. The monsters might ignore you,
so you can get by with a few months of summer training and live in the mortal world the rest of
the year. But for some of us, it's too dangerous to leave. We're year-rounders. In the mortal world,
we attract monsters. They sense us. They come to challenge us. Most of the time, they'll ignore us
until we're old enough to cause troubleâ€”about ten or eleven years old, but after that, most
demigods either make their way here, or they get killed off. A few manage to survive in the
outside world and become famous. Believe me, if I told you the names, you'd know them. Some
don't even realize they're demigods. But very, very few are like that."
"So monsters can't get in here?"
Annabeth shook her head. "Not unless they're intentionally stocked in the woods or specially
summoned by somebody on the inside."
"Why would anybody want to summon a monster?"
"Practice fights. Practical jokes."
"Practical jokes?"
"The point is, the borders are sealed to keep mortals and monsters out. From the outside,
mortals look into the valley and see nothing unusual, just a strawberry farm."
