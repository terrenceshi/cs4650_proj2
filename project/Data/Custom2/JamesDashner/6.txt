Thomas knew he was a smart kid—he somehow felt it in his bones. But nothing about this place made
any sense. Except for one thing. He was supposed to be a Runner. Why did he feel that so strongly? And
even now, after seeing what lived in the maze?
A tap on his shoulder jarred him from his thoughts; he looked up to see Alby standing behind him, arms
folded.
“Ain’t you lookin’ fresh?” Alby said. “Get a nice view out the window this morning?”
Thomas stood, hoping the time for answers had come—or maybe hoping for a distraction from his
gloomy thoughts. “Enough to make me want to learn about this place,” he said, hoping to avoid provoking
the temper he’d seen flare in this guy the day before.
Alby nodded. “Me and you, shank. The Tour begins now.” He started to move but then stopped, holding
up a finger. “Ain’t no questions till the end, you get me? Ain’t got time to jaw with you all day.”
“But ...” Thomas stopped when Alby’s eyebrows shot up. Why did the guy have to be such a jerk? “But
tell me everything—I wanna know everything.” He’d decided the night before not to tell anyone else how
strangely familiar the place seemed, the odd feeling that he’d been there before—that he could remember
things about it. Sharing that seemed like a very bad idea.
“I’ll tell ya what I wanna tell ya, Greenie. Let’s go.”
“Can I come?” Chuck asked fromthe table.
Alby reached down and tweaked the boy’s ear.
“Ow!” Chuck shrieked.
“Ain’t you got a job, slinthead?” Alby asked. “Lots of sloppin’ to do?”
Chuck rolled his eyes, then looked at Thomas. “Have fun.”
“I’ll try.” He suddenly felt sorry for Chuck, wished people would treat the kid better. But there was
nothing he could do about it—it was time to go.
