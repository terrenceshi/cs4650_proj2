It would’ve been hard enough with Zia’s comments about
passing our tests or dying, but the girls’ dormitory just wasn’t
as posh as Amos’s mansion. The stone walls sweated moisture.
Creepy pictures of Egyptian monsters danced across the
ceiling in the torchlight. I got a floating cot to sleep in, and the
other girls in training—initiates, Zia had called them—were
much younger than me, so when the old dorm matron told
them to go to sleep straightaway, they actually obeyed. The
matron waved her hand and the torches went out. She shut the
door behind her, and I could hear the sound of locks clicking.
Lovely. Imprisoned in a nursery school dungeon.
I stared into the dark until I heard the other girls snoring.
A single thought kept bothering me: an urge I just couldn’t
shake. Finally I crept out of bed and tugged on my boots.
I felt my way to the door. I tugged at the handle. Locked,
as I suspected. I was tempted to kick it till I remembered what
Zia had done in the Cairo Airport broom closet.
I pressed my palm against the door and whispered,
“Sahad.”
Locks clicked. The door swung open. Handy trick.
Outside, the corridors were dark and empty. Apparently,
there wasn’t much nightlife in the First Nome. I sneaked
through the city back the way we’d come and saw nothing but
an occasional cobra slithering across the floor
