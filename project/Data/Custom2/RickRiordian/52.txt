Bast sighed. She put her hand on Sadie’s, and the burn
marks faded. “I did tell you. Isis channeled her power through
the amulet, yes, but she’s not there now. She’s in you. And
even so, magical amulets are practically indestructible.”
“So what are we supposed to do?” Sadie said.
“Well, for starters,” Bast said, “Carter must use the power
of Horus to defeat Set.”
“Oh, is that all?” I said. “All by myself?”
“No, no. Sadie can help.”
“Oh, super.”
“I’ll guide you as much as possible,” Bast promised, “but
in the end, the two of you must fight. Only Horus and Isis can
defeat Set and avenge the death of Osiris. That’s the way it
was before. That’s the way it must be now.”
“Then we get our dad back?” I asked.
Bast’s smile wavered. “If all goes well.”
She wasn’t telling us everything. No surprise. But my
brain was too fuzzy to figure out what I was missing.
