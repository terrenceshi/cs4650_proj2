"Please, dears," Aunty Em pleaded. "I so rarely get to be with children. Before you go, won't
you at least sit for a pose?"
"A pose?" Annabeth asked warily.
"A photograph. I will use it to model a new statue set. Children are so popular, you see.
Everyone loves children."
Annabeth shifted her weight from foot to foot. "I don't think we can, ma'am. Come on,
Percyâ€”"
"Sure we can," I said. I was irritated with Annabeth for being so bossy, so rude to an old lady
who'd just fed us for free. "It's just a photo, Annabeth. What's the harm?"
"Yes, Annabeth," the woman purred. "No harm."
I could tell Annabeth didn't like it, but she allowed Aunty Em to lead us back out the front
door, into the garden of statues.
Aunty Em directed us to a park bench next to the stone satyr. "Now," she said, "I'll just
position you correctly. The young girl in the middle, I think, and the two young gentlemen on
either side."
"Not much light for a photo," I remarked.
"Oh, enough," Aunty Em said. "Enough for us to see each other, yes?"
"Where's your camera?" Grover asked.
Aunty Em stepped back, as if to admire the shot. "Now, the face is the most difficult. Can you
smile for me please, everyone? A large smile?"
