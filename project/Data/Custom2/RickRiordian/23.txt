Five minutes before she died, Grace Cahill changed her will.
Her lawyer brought out the alternate version, which had been her most guarded
secret for seven years. Whether or not she would actually be crazy enough to use
it, William McIntyre had never been certain.
"Madam," he asked, "are you sure?"
Grace gazed out the window, across the sunlit meadows other estate. Her cat,
Saladin, snuggled beside her as he had throughout her illness, but his presence
was not enough to comfort her today. She was about to set in motion events that
might cause the end of civilization.
"Yes, William." Her every breath was painful. "I'm sure."
William broke the seal on the brown leather folder. He was a tall craggy man.
His nose was pointed like a sundial so it always cast a shadow over one side of
his face. He had been Grace's adviser, her closest confidant, for half her life.
They'd shared many secrets over the years, but none as perilous as this.
