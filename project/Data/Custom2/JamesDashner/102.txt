She nudged Dak, then turned to look. Two men — one short, one tall —

were making their way along the decks. They both had long black hair and shirts that revealed their entire arms, which were ripped with muscle.

“Those’re the Amancio brothers,” she whispered.

“You’re right,” he said back. “I’ve seen paintings, and that’s definitely them! The tall one is Salvador, the shorter one Raul.”

Sera flicked a glance at Riq, but he was too far away to join the conversation. “What do you think? Is this mutiny supposed to happen or what?”

“I don’t know. We need to snoop around and learn more, I guess. We’ve only got a few days before they do it.”

“Huh? How do you know that?”

He gave her his special look that said, How can you possibly doubt my infinite wisdom?

“Slacking on the job, are we?” a voice said from behind them.

Sera spun to see that the Amancios had stopped directly in front of them.

The taller one — Salvador — leaned over and put his hands on his knees.

“So you’re the ones old Eyeball brought in for us today, eh?” he asked.

The man smiled, and he looked way too kind for someone about to throw the captain overboard. “Well, work hard and you’ll do great things here.”

He straightened, and then his brother Raul spoke. “Great things indeed.

You’re going to be a part of history, boys. Is this your first voyage?”

Sera and Dak, both a little starstruck, only nodded.

Raul looked out at the distant sea, where the sun was almost ready to dip below the horizon. “Ah, there’s nothing more invigorating than the open sea.

You pips are gonna love it.”
