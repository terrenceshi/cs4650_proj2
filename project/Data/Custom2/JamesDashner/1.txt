He began his new life standing up, surrounded by cold darkness and stale, dusty air.
Metal ground against metal; a lurching shudder shook the floor beneath him. He fell down at the sudden
movement and shuffled backward on his hands and feet, drops of sweat beading on his forehead despite
the cool air. His back struck a hard metal wall; he slid along it until he hit the corner of the room. Sinking
to the floor, he pulled his legs up tight against his body, hoping his eyes would soon adjust to the
darkness.
With another jolt, the roomjerked upward like an old lift in a mine shaft.
Harsh sounds of chains and pulleys, like the workings of an ancient steel factory, echoed through the
room, bouncing off the walls with a hollow, tinny whine. The lightless elevator swayed back and forth as
it ascended, turning the boy’s stomach sour with nausea; a smell like burnt oil invaded his senses, making
himfeel worse. He wanted to cry, but no tears came; he could only sit there, alone, waiting.
My name is Thomas, he thought.
That ... that was the only thing he could remember about his life.
He didn’t understand how this could be possible. His mind functioned without flaw, trying to calculate
his surroundings and predicament. Knowledge flooded his thoughts, facts and images, memories and
details of the world and how it works. He pictured snow on trees, running down a leaf-strewn road,
eating a hamburger, the moon casting a pale glow on a grassy meadow, swimming in a lake, a busy city
square with hundreds of people bustling about their business.
And yet he didn’t know where he came from, or how he’d gotten inside the dark lift, or who his parents
were. He didn’t even know his last name. Images of people flashed across his mind, but there was no
recognition, their faces replaced with haunted smears of color. He couldn’t think of one person he knew,
or recall a single conversation.
