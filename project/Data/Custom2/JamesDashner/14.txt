For the second night in a row, Thomas went to bed with the haunted image of Ben’s face burned into his
mind, tormenting him. How different would things be right now if it weren’t for that one boy? Thomas
could almost convince himself he’d be completely content, happy and excited to learn his new life, aim
for his goal of being a Runner. Almost. Deep down he knew that Ben was only part of his many problems.
But now he was gone, Banished to the world of the Grievers, taken to wherever they took their prey,
victim to whatever was done there. Though he had plenty of reasons to despise Ben, he mostly felt sorry
for him.
Thomas couldn’t imagine going out that way, but based on Ben’s last moments, psychotically thrashing
and spitting and screaming, he no longer doubted the importance of the Glade rule that no one should enter
the Maze except Runners, and then only during the day. Somehow Ben had already been stung once, which
meant he knew better than perhaps anyone just exactly what lay in store for him.
That poor guy, he thought. That poor, poor guy.
Thomas shuddered and rolled over on his side. The more he thought about it, being a Runner didn’t
sound like such a great idea. But, inexplicably, it still called to him.
The next morning, dawn had barely touched the sky before the working sounds of the Glade wakened
Thomas from the deepest slumber since he’d arrived. He sat up, rubbing his eyes, trying to shake the
heavy grogginess. Giving up, he lay back down, hoping no one would bother him.
It didn’t last a minute.
