It is up to YOU to save the French Revolution!

In 1792, the French Revolution was defeated when members of the SQ

snuck into the Royal Storehouse in Paris and stole the French Blue Diamond

— one of the biggest and brightest of the Crown Jewels. Above is a sketch of the blue diamond in its setting of more than a hundred smaller gems.

The SQ passed the French Blue off to King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, who used it to bribe their way out of the city, raise an army, and brutally crush the Revolution. The SQ has controlled France ever since.

You will have to find a way to prevent this from happening. Jacques, a Revolutionary and our on-the-ground Hystorian, will be able to help you.

Good luck.

P.S. Please take photos of important sights for our records. But BE

CAREFUL! Photography doesn’t exist yet in 1792, so don’t let ANYONE see your camera or they’ll know right away you’re a time traveler.

King Louis XVI was a pretty smart guy but unfit for the role of king. He was really bad at making decisions and hated confrontation. (In other words, a perfect puppet for the SQ.)

Hystorians use Timeboxes to stash items that might help travelers from the future.

DON’T GO SWIMMING. The sewers empty directly into the Seine, the river that runs through the city. Yuck.

Be on the lookout for currency of the time period!

The French Blue, which came to be known as the Hope Diamond, is perhaps the largest and most perfect blue diamond in the world. Still, it’s rumored to be cursed. I don’t believe in that kind of thing — but you can’t say I didn’t warn you. . . .

I'm not sure who this note is from, but it seems to relate to this Break. Maybe you'll be able to figure out what it means.
