Chiron pursed his lips. "Even I am not old enough to remember that, child, but I know it was
a time of darkness and savagery for mortals. Kronos, the lord of the Titans, called his reign the
Golden Age because men lived innocent and free of all knowledge. But that was mere
propaganda. The Titan king cared nothing for your kind except as appetizers or a source of cheap
entertainment. It was only in the early reign of Lord Zeus, when Prometheus the good Titan
brought fire to mankind, that your species began to progress, and even then Prometheus was
branded a radical thinker. Zeus punished him severely, as you may recall. Of course, eventually
the gods warmed to humans, and Western civilization was born."
"But the gods can't die now, right? I mean, as long as Western civilization is alive, they're
alive. So ... even if I failed, nothing could happen so bad it would mess up everything, right?"
Chiron gave me a melancholy smile. "No one knows how long the Age of the West will last,
Percy. The gods are immortal, yes. But then, so were the Titans. They still exist, locked away in
their various prisons, forced to endure endless pain and punishment, reduced in power, but still
very much alive. May the Fates forbid that the gods should ever suffer such a doom, or that we
should ever return to the darkness and chaos of the past. All we can do, child, is follow our
destiny."
"Our destiny ... assuming we know what that is."
"Relax," Chiron told me. "Keep a clear head. And remember, you may be about to prevent
the biggest war in human history."
"Relax," I said. "I'm very relaxed."
When I got to the bottom of the hill, I looked back. Under the pine tree that used to be Thalia,
daughter of Zeus, Chiron was now standing in full horse-man form, holding his bow high in
salute. Just your typical summer-camp send-off by your typical centaur.
