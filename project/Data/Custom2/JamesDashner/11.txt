And then Thomas saw perhaps the most disturbing thing he’d seen since he’d arrived at the Glade.
Chuck didn’t answer; he only smiled. Smiled, despite it all, despite the sinister sound of what he’d just
announced. Then he turned and ran, maybe to tell someone else the exciting news.

That night, Newt and Alby gathered every last Glader at the East Door about a half hour before it closed,
the first traces of twilight’s dimness creeping across the sky. The Runners had just returned and entered
the mysterious Map Room, clanging the iron door shut; Minho had already gone in earlier. Alby told the
Runners to hurry about their business—he wanted themback out in twenty minutes.
It still bothered Thomas how Chuck had smiled when breaking the news about Ben being Banished.
Though he didn’t know exactly what it meant, it certainly didn’t sound like a good thing. Especially since
they were all standing so close to the Maze. Are they going to put him out there? he wondered. With the
Grievers?
The other Gladers murmured their conversations in hushed tones, an intense feeling of dreadful
anticipation hanging over them like a patch of thick fog. But Thomas said nothing, standing with arms
folded, waiting for the show. He stood quietly until the Runners finally came out of their building, all of
them looking exhausted, their faces pinched from deep thinking. Minho had been the first to exit, which
made Thomas wonder if he was the Keeper of the Runners.
