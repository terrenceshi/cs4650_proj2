Luke stood on the balcony above me, a smile on his scarred face. He wore jeans, a white T-shirt, and
flip-flops, like he was just a normal college-age guy, but his eyes told the truth. They were solid gold.
"We've been expecting you for days." At first he sounded normal, like Luke. But then his face
twitched. A shudder passed through his body as though he'd just drunk something really nasty. His voice
became heavier, ancient, and powerfulâ€”the voice of the Titan lord Kronos. The words scraped down my
spine like a knife blade. "Come, bow before me."
"Yeah, that'll happen," I muttered.
Laistrygonian giants filed in on either side of the swimming pool as if they'd been waiting for a cue.
Each was eight feet tall with tattooed arms, leather armor, and spiked clubs. Demigod archers appeared on
the roof above Luke. Two hellhounds leaped down from the opposite balcony and snarled at me. Within
seconds I was surrounded. A trap: there's no way they could've gotten into position so fast unless they'd
known I was coming.
I looked up at Luke, and anger boiled inside me. I didn't know if Luke's consciousness was even still
alive inside that body. Maybe, the way his voice had changed . . . or maybe it was just Kronos adapting to
his new form. I told myself it didn't matter. Luke had been twisted and evil long before Kronos possessed
him.
A voice in my head said: I have to fight him eventually. Why not now?
According to that big prophecy, I was supposed to make a choice that saved or destroyed the world
when I was sixteen. That was only seven days away. Why not now? If I really had the power, what
difference would a week make? I could end this threat right here by taking down Kronos. Hey, I'd fought
monsters and gods before.
As if reading my thoughts, Luke smiled. No, he was Kronos. I had to remember that.
"Come forward," he said. "If you dare."
