My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all i could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card
And all i got was a brand new sports car
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
Oooh-hoo
Oooh-hoo
Ooooh-hooo
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
Oooh-hoo
Oooh-hoo
Ooooh-hooo
Dad cracked a joke all the kids laughed
But i couldn't hear 'em all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
Oooh-hoo
Oooh-hoo
Ooooh-hooo
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions I gotta get with it
Oooh-hoo
Oooh-hoo
Ooooh-hooo
I seen it
I seen it before
I seen it
I seen it before
I seen it
I seen it before
I seen it
I seen it before
My god-sister getting married by the lake
But I couldnt figure out who I wanna take
Bad enough that i showed up late
I had to leave before they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak
And my head keeps spinning
Cant stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
Oooh-hoo
Oooh-hoo
Ooooh-hooo
And my head keeps spinning
I can't keep having these visions, I gotta get with it
Oooh-hoo
Oooh-hoo
Ooooh-hooo
Ooooh-hooo
Ooooh-hooo
Ooooh-hooo
And I, and I can't stop
No, no I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
I can't stop
I can't stop
I can't stop
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, I can't stop
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it
Ohhoo ohhoo
Ohhhhoooo
