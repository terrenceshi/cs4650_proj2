I owe so much of my life to the good people at Random House and
Delacorte Press. Over the years of the Maze Runner series, so many
of you contributed countless hours, and blood, sweat, and tears to
make it a success. Management, editing, publicity, marketing,
copyediting, design, the sales team …  so much hard work,
spearheaded by Beverly Horowitz and Krista Marino. I just want all
of you to know how deeply, eternally, monumentally (insert a few
more adverbs—plenty were cut from the books themselves) grateful
I am to have been a part of it.
And now I’m so excited for this new story and the next few years
of working with all of you.
Of course, all that hard work would’ve been pointless if it weren’t
for my faithful, passionate, amazing, sometimes crazy, always
awesome readers. I really, truly hope this new story will put you on
the edge of your seats and spin your minds just as much as the Maze
Runner series did. Thank you for liking my books. I don’t know a
fancier way to say that. Thank you. You make my life fun.
A special thanks to J. Scott Savage and Julie Wright. Just
because. Also to Lauren Abramo and everyone at Dystel & Goderich
for ensuring that as many people as possible can read my books all
around the world. Thank you!
