At the top of the Arch, the observation deck reminded me of a tin can with carpeting. Rows
of tiny windows looked out over the city on one side and the river on the other. The view was
okay, but if there's anything I like less than a confined space, it's a confined space six hundred
feet in the air. I was ready to go pretty quick.
Annabeth kept talking about structural supports, and how she would've made the windows
bigger, and designed a see-through floor. She probably could've stayed up there for hours, but
luckily for me the park ranger announced that the observation deck would be closing in a few
minutes.
I steered Grover and Annabeth toward the exit, loaded them into the elevator, and I was about
to get in myself when I realized there were already two other tourists inside. No room for me.
The park ranger said, "Next car, sir."
"We'll get out," Annabeth said. "We'll wait with you."
But that was going to mess everybody up and take even more time, so I said, "Naw, it's okay.
I'll see you guys at the bottom."
Grover and Annabeth both looked nervous, but they let the elevator door slide shut. Their car
disappeared down the ramp.
Now the only people left on the observation deck were me, a little boy with his parents, the
park ranger, and the fat lady with her Chihuahua.
I smiled uneasily at the fat lady. She smiled back, her forked tongue flickering between her
teeth.
