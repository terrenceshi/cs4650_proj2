Michael knew that most people, when they felt as if the earth itself
decided it just didn’t like them anymore, when they felt like they
were at the bottom of a dark pit, went to their mom or dad. Maybe
a brother, maybe a sister. Those with none of the above might nd
themselves knocking at the door of an aunt, a grandpa, a third
cousin twice removed.
But not Michael. He went to Bryson and Sarah, the two best
friends a person could ever ask for. They knew him like no one else,
and they didn’t care what he said or did or wore or ate. And he
returned the favor whenever they needed him. But there was
something very strange about their friendship.
Michael had never met them.
Not literally, anyway. Not yet. They were VirtNet friends through
and through, though. He’d gotten to know them rst in the
beginning levels of Lifeblood, and they’d grown closer and closer the
higher up they went. The three of them had joined forces almost
from the day they met to move up in the Game of all Games. They
were the Terrible Trio, the Trifecta to Dissect-ya, the Burn-andPillage-y Trilogy. Their nicknames didn’t make them many friends
—they’d been branded cocky by some, idiots by others—but they
had fun, so they didn’t care
