“going native.” Gloria tsk ed at his complaints. She insisted that they needed to look a lot less like nobles, and fast. It was customary that hired hands spent the night before launch on the ship itself, so they had no time to lose.

Sera was a nervous wreck, and it didn’t help that she hated what Gloria had done to her — dirt was one thing, but she felt completely naked without that comforting sense of hair on her neck. She still had enough to wear a ponytail, but just barely. Fortunately, men of the period didn’t wear their hair too short.

“Hey, you make a pretty convincing boy,” Riq said to her after she was all dirtied up. He smiled to soften the blow.

“You don’t,” she replied, but gave a smile back.

Dak finally joined Gloria on one horse — after three failed attempts to get up in the saddle and a whole lot of complaining that the bicycle hadn’t been invented yet — and Sera sat with Riq on the other. He tried to sit in front but she refused — it was already humiliating enough for her to pretend to be a boy. She’d at least have the satisfaction of taking lead on the stupid animal.

Why was she in such a bad mood? Just because of a haircut? She tried to

convince herself it wasn’t because Dak was raring to go for a sailing adventure with the famous Amancio brothers and didn’t seem scared one bit.

Once they were all mounted up, Gloria turned her horse to face Sera’s. “I know an out-of-the-way path that’ll get us to the port house where we should find my friend, Stonebull. I’m not expecting any trouble, but if we cross paths with that Time Warden or any of his friends, there’d be no point in fighting.

These horses are swift, and we’ll have to rely on their legs to save us. If we can reach Stonebull, we’ll tell him that the Warden is just someone you stole food from and who wants revenge. He won’t care a bit about that — he’ll simply be happy to have a few extra hands to replace those who inevitably chicken out on the last day.”
