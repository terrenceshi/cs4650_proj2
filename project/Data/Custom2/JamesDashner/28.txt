we’re just waiting for Kaine to stroll right in, and he’ll nd us
eventually. You stay while we make a break for the door.”
“No,” she said. “I’m not leaving you until we’re all safe.”
Her protectiveness surprised him. “All right, but you know as
well as we do, it can only get worse. Especially if Kaine shows up.”
“And how do you expect to ght those things o when they
pounce on us?” Bryson asked.
“Don’t let them bite you,” Sarah answered.
Ronika pointed to the screen. “We just have to make it up those
stairs outside the door. Somehow Kaine’s blocked me from
contacting my security detail. But once we’re to the top and into the
main section of the club, my bouncers will swarm and be too much
even for the KillSims.”
“Okay. To the door, then,” Michael said. “And up the stairs. No
problem.” But the truth was, terror raced through his body, making
it hard for him to breathe.
“We need to stick together,” Sarah added. “Stay in a pack.”
Michael got onto his hands and knees, ready to crawl through the
secret door. “Bryson, you’re closest, so you’ll have to go rst.”
“Figures,” he replied.
Michael knew Bryson was kidding, but he was right. It shouldn’t
be him at the front. Michael pushed his way past Sarah and then
Bryson to get to the exit. “No—I got us into this mess,” he said. “I’ll
go rst.”
“But now if you die I’ll feel bad,” Bryson whined.
Michael liked that his friend was at least trying to keep his sense
of humor. “You’ll just have to live with it.”
