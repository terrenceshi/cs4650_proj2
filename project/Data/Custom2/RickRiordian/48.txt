“It’ll be all right,” I promised, trying not to sound scared
out of my mind. “The house is protected by magic.”
“Sadie,” Carter said. “They’ve found something.”
The serpopards had converged at the left-hand door and
were intently sniffing the handle.
“Isn’t it locked?” I asked.
Both monsters smashed their ugly faces against the glass.
The door shuddered. Blue hieroglyphs glowed along the
doorframe, but their light was faint.
“I don’t like this,” Carter murmured.
I prayed that the monsters would give up. Or that perhaps
Philip of Macedonia would climb back to the terrace (do
crocodiles climb?) and renew the fight.
Instead, the monsters smashed their heads against the
glass again. This time a web of cracks appeared. The blue
hieroglyphs flickered and died.
“AGH!” Khufu screamed. He waved his hand vaguely at
the cat.
“Maybe if I try the ha-di spell,” I said.
Carter shook his head. “You almost fainted after you blew
up those doors. I don’t want you passing out, or worse.”
Carter once again surprised me. He tugged a strange
sword from one of Amos’s wall displays. The blade had an
odd crescent-moon curve and looked horribly impractical.
