Amy shook her head. "It used to be called the Island of the Cows, because that's
all that lived there. Then they turned it into a neighborhood."
"Cows," Dan said. "Exciting."
After the other parts of Paris they'd seen, the ÃŽle St-Louis felt like a ghost town.
The narrow streets were lined with elegant old apartments -- five stories tall with
black gabled roofs. Most of the windows were dark. A lot of the shops were
closed.
Streetlamps cast weird shadows through the branches of the trees, making
monster shapes on the walls. Amy was too old to believe in monsters, but the
shadows still made her uneasy.
An elderly couple crossed the street in front of them. Amy wondered if it was
her imagination, or if the couple really glanced at her suspiciously before they
disappeared into an alleyway. On the next block, a guy in a beret was walking a
Labrador retriever.
He smiled as he passed Amy and Dan, but his expression reminded Amy of Ian
Kabra -- like he knew a secret.
