The animal had a lion’s body and the head of a falcon, but
its wings weren’t like most griffin pictures you see. Instead of
bird wings, the monster’s wings ran across the top of its back
—long, horizontal, and bristly like a pair of upside-down steel
brushes. If the monster could’ve flown with those things at all,
I figured they must’ve moved like a butterfly’s wings. The
frieze had once been painted. I could make out flecks of red
and gold on the creature’s hide; but even without color, the
griffin looked eerily lifelike. Its beady eyes seemed to follow
me.
“Griffins were protectors,” I said, remembering
something my dad had once told me. “They guarded treasures
and stuff.”
“Fab,” Sadie said. “So you mean they attacked…oh,
thieves, for instance, breaking into museums and stealing
artifacts?”
“It’s just a frieze,” I said. But I doubt that made anyone
feel better. Egyptian magic was all about turning words and
pictures into reality.
“There.” Walt pointed across the room. “That’s it, right?”
We made a wide arc around the griffin and walked over
to a statue in the center of the room.
The god stood about eight feet tall. He was carved from
black stone and dressed in typical Egyptian style: barechested, with a kilt and sandals. He had the face of a ram and
horns that had partially broken off over the centuries. On his
head was a Frisbee-shaped crown—a sun disk, braided with
serpents. In front of him stood a much smaller human figure.
The god was holding his hands over the little dude’s head, as
though giving him a blessing.
