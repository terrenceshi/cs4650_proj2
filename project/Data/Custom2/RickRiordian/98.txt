Argus rummaged around in the back of his van. He brought out a bronze shield and passed it to
Annabeth. It looked pretty much standard issue—the same kind of round shield we always used in
capture the flag. But when Annabeth set it on the ground, the reflection on the polished metal changed
from sky and buildings to the Statue of Liberty—which wasn't anywhere close to us.
"Whoa," I said. "A video shield."
"One of Daedalus's ideas," Annabeth said. "I had Beckendorf make this before—" She glanced at
Silena. "Um, anyway, the shield bends sunlight or moonlight from anywhere in the world to create a
reflection. You can literally see any target under the sun or moon, as long as natural light is touching it.
Look."
We crowded around as Annabeth concentrated. The image zoomed and spun at first, so I got motion
sickness just watching it. We were in the Central Park Zoo, then zooming down East 60th, past
Bloomingdale's, then turning on Third Avenue.
"Whoa," Connor Stoll said. "Back up. Zoom in right there."
"What?" Annabeth said nervously. "You see invaders?"
"No, right there—Dylan's Candy Bar." Connor grinned at his brother. "Dude, it's open. And everyone
is asleep. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
"Connor!" Katie Gardner scolded. She sounded like her mother, Demeter. "This is serious. You are
not going to loot a candy store in the middle of a war!"
"Sorry," Connor muttered, but he didn't sound very ashamed.
Annabeth passed her hand in front of the shield, and another scene popped up: FDR Drive, looking
across the river at Lighthouse Park.
"This will let us see what's going on across the city," she said. "Thank you, Argus. Hopefully we'll
see you back at camp . . . someday."
Argus grunted. He gave me a look that clearly meant Good luck; you'll need it, then climbed into his
van. He and the two harpy drivers swerved away, weaving around clusters of idle cars that littered the
road.
