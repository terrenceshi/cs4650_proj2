“That’s the theory, Dak. I’m sorry, but this is all uncharted territory here.

All I know for sure is that the second we start changing things, the time line will be in flux and we won’t be able to take anything for granted. All we can do is make the changes the Hystorians tell us to and hope for the best.

Otherwise we might go back to discover the planet is a chunk of dead rock floating through space.”

Riq moved closer and eyed the satchel in Dak’s hands. “Okay, fine. So how in the world do we know what to do? They didn’t tell me anything about the Breaks, their locations, nothing. I started my training in The Art of Memory, but hadn’t gotten too far.”

“Then it’s a good thing two out of three of us are smart,” Dak said, stepping up beside Riq. “We’ll figure it out. You just be a good boy and translate.”

Riq laughed, which made Dak’s face grow red. “How many languages do you know, by the way? I forgot.”

“One,” Dak said in a deadpan voice.

“Ah, okay. When I need help with English, I’ll come to you.”

“And when I need help on how to look stupider, I’ll come to you.”

Riq pointed a finger at Dak’s ear. “Just remember, as impressive as that device is, it won’t help you with reading and writing. You’re basically illiterate now. Just sayin’.”

Sera cleared her throat. Dak was usually so quick to trust strangers. She wondered if Riq reminded Dak a little too much of himself. “You guys finished?” she asked. They each gave the other a dirty look, but then nodded at her. “For the love of mincemeat. Dak, you can’t be dumb and learn tons of languages. And, Riq, you better be nice to my best friend — he knows more about history than your bosses. I guarantee it.” She waited a moment to make sure she’d put their argument to rest, then took a deep breath. “Dak, there’s something else. I’ve been thinking about your parents, and I think they’re anomalies, too.”
