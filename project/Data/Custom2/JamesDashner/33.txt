“Your demons are always with you,” Skale answered. His voice
seemed even raspier than the day before. “Don’t you understand
that by now? Always with you, impossible to escape. But you never
can guess how they might manifest themselves. Be wary, my
children. Now come. Quickly.”
“Where are we going?” Sarah asked insistently.
Skale didn’t answer, just crossed the room and opened the door,
slipping into the hallway. Michael grabbed Sarah’s hand, and they
followed him into the dark. Michael could barely see Skale making
his way toward the stairs, and he rushed, pulling Sarah along, to
catch up to him.
The group climbed down the steps and Skale led them to the
dining area where they’d eaten the night before.
“Please have a seat,” Skale said, gesturing to the wooden chairs.
“I’ll go and ask our friends to join us.”
Michael was having trouble putting everything together. He was
foggy from sleep, and though his pain had disappeared, he still felt
weak from the episode—the pain and the hallucinations were at the
front of his mind. And now he was supposed to be readying for a
battle with demons? What did Skale mean, that they were always
here? Shaking his head, Michael sat in a chair, wincing at the sound
of the legs scraping across the oor. Maybe somehow they could
hack their way out of trouble this time before it began.
Sarah sat beside him. “We have to think. He said that we’d
already been given all the information we need. Can you remember
everything else he said? I think it probably has something to do
with the prayer before dinner.”
“Yeah,” Michael agreed, yet for the life of him he couldn’t
remember a single word. “But all I can remember is the stu about
Kaine.”
