A low, raspy mumble—what Mark thought a man on his deathbed
might sound like—answered. The words were a jumble of lost
syllables.
“What’s that?” Alec asked.
The man didn’t move, didn’t reply. He sat on his cot, facing away
from them, a lump of a human body. Head down, shoulders
slumped.
Mark suddenly had to know—had to—what the guy had said. He
started walking down the aisle between the cots, ignoring the short
burst of protest from Alec. As he made his way toward the man, the
spaces between the cots ashing by, he heard Alec hurrying to catch
up to him, the light from the workpad bobbing about and making
weird shadows dance on the walls.
Mark slowed as he neared the slumped man, felt an icy tingle
across his skin. The stranger was broad-shouldered and thickchested, but his demeanor made him look frail and pathetic. Mark
steered clear a few feet as he reached the man’s side, saw a face
covered in shadow and hanging low.
“What did you say?” Mark asked when he was in front of the man.
Alec reached his side and held the workpad up to cast light on the
visibly depressed stranger. The man sat forward with elbows on
knees, hands clenched together, his entire visage appearing as if it
might melt and drip onto the oor.
The man slowly raised his eyes and looked at them, his head
tilting on his neck like rusty machinery.
