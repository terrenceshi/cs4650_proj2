“Oh, yeah,” Alec said in a tight whisper. “I do. I really think I do.”
“And?” Mark was almost bursting from curiosity now.
Instead of answering, Alec leaned down and grabbed one of the
objects from the box. He lifted it up—the thing was the size and
shape of a rie—and examined it, turning it in his hands. It
appeared to be made mostly of silver metal and plastic, with little
tubes spiraling down the long shaft of its main body. One end was a
gunlike butt with a trigger, and the other end looked like an
elongated bubble with a spout popping out. There was a strap to
sling across your shoulder.
“What is that thing?” Mark asked, hearing the awe in his own
voice.
Alec was just shaking his head back and forth, in obvious disbelief
as he continued studying the object in his hands. “Do you have any
idea how much these things cost? They were way too expensive to
ever make it to the actual weapons market. I can’t believe I’m
holding one.”
“What?” Mark asked, lled with impatience. “What is it?”
Alec nally looked up and met his eyes. “This bad boy is called a
Transvice.”
“A Transvice?” Mark repeated. “What does it do?”
Alec held the strange weapon up as if it were some holy relic.
“It makes people dissolve into thin air.”
