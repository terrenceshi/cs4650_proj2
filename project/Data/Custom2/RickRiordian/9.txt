She pushed ahead, leaving me in the dust.
"Okay," I mumbled. "Glad you wanted me on your team."
It was a warm, sticky night. The woods were dark, with fireflies popping in and out of view.
Annabeth stationed me next to a little creek that gurgled over some rocks, then she and the rest of
the team scattered into the trees.
Standing there alone, with my big blue-feathered helmet and my huge shield, I felt like an
idiot. The bronze sword, like all the swords I'd tried so far, seemed balanced wrong. The leather
grip pulled on my hand like a bowling ball.
There was no way anybody would actually attack me, would they? I mean, Olympus had to
have liability issues, right?
Far away, the conch horn blew. I heard whoops and yells in the woods, the clanking of metal,
kids fighting. A blue-plumed ally from Apollo raced past me like a deer, leaped through the
creek, and disappeared into enemy territory.
Great, I thought. I'll miss all the fun, as usual.
Then I heard a sound that sent a chill up my spine, a low canine growl, somewhere close by.
I raised my shield instinctively; I had the feeling something was stalking me.
Then the growling stopped. I felt the presence retreating.
On the other side of the creek, the underbrush exploded. Five Ares warriors came yelling and
screaming out of the dark.
"Cream the punk!" Clarisse screamed.
Her ugly pig eyes glared through the slits of her helmet. She brandished a five-foot-long
spear, its barbed metal tip flickering with red light. Her siblings had only the standard-issue
bronze swordsâ€”not that that made me feel any better.
