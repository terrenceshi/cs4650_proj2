You know I adore you
I'm crazier for you
Then I was at sixteen
Lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens
Marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory
Faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless
Ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns
I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life
Ah, ah, ah
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there
To see you there
It's been a long time coming but
It's you and me
That's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "she's a bad, bad girl" (okay!)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me
There's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay!)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away
With you
My team is losing
Battered and bruising
I see the high fives
Between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung
You are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories
Burning before me
I'm feeling helpless
The damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys, then
Where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared
Ah, ah, ah
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there
To see you there
And now the storm is coming, but
It's you and me
That's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "she's a bad, bad girl" (okay!)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me
There's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay!)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away
With you
And I don't want you to (go)
I don't really wanna (fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (win)
I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (go)
I don't really wanna (fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (win)
I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (go)
I don't really wanna (fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (win)
I just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (go)
'Cause I know this is a (fight)
That someday we're gonna (win)
It's you and me
That's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "she's a bad, bad girl"
Oh, I just thought you should know
You should know
It's you and me
There's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay!)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (paint it blue)
Voted most likely to run away
With you
I don't really wanna (fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (win)
I think you should come home
And I'll never let you (go)
'Cause I know this is a (fight)
That someday we're gonna (win)
Just thought you should know
You and me
That's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "she's a bad, bad girl"
"She's a bad, bad girl"
