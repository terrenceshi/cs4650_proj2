Thomas shared a bunk with Minho, who insisted on sleeping up top; Newt and Frypan were right next to
them. The staff put Teresa up in a separate room, shuffling her away before she could even say goodbye.
Thomas missed her desperately three seconds after she was gone.
As Thomas was settling into the soft mattress for the night, he was interrupted.
“Hey, Thomas,” Minho said fromabove him.
“Yeah?” Thomas was so tired the word barely came out.
“What do you think happened to the Gladers who stayed behind?”
Thomas hadn’t thought about it. His mind had been occupied with Chuck and now Teresa. “I don’t
know. But based on how many of us died getting here, I wouldn’t like to be one of them right now.
Grievers are probably swarming all over them.” He couldn’t believe how nonchalant his voice sounded
as he said it.
“You think we’re safe with these people?” Minho asked.
Thomas pondered the question for a moment. There was only one answer to hold on to. “Yeah, I think
we’re safe.”
Minho said something else, but Thomas didn’t hear. Exhaustion consuming him, his mind wandered to
his short time in the Maze, his time as a Runner and how much he’d wanted it—ever since that first night
in the Glade. It felt like a hundred years ago. Like a dream.
Murmurs of conversation floated through the room, but to Thomas they seemed to come from another
world. He stared at the crossed wooden boards of the bed above him, feeling the pull of sleep. But
wanting to talk to Teresa, he fought it off.
How’s your room? he asked in his mind. Wish you were in here.
Oh, yeah? she replied. With all those stinky boys? Think not.
Guess you’re right. I think Minho’s farted three times in the last minute. Thomas knew it was a lame
attempt at a joke, but it was the best he could do.
