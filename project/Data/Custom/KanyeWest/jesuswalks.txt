Order, huh
Yo, we at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
But most of all we at war with ourselves
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walks with me, with me, with me, with me, with me)
You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless - might snatch ya necklace
And next these - might jack ya Lexus
Somebody tell these - who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless
Try to catch it, it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be asking us questions, harass, and arrest us
Saying, "We eat pieces of sh- like you for breakfast!"
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of sh-? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere, but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My Mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well Mama, I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move, I hope
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now (I want Jesus)
(Jesus walks)
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus walks with me)
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walks)
And I don't think there's nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus walks with me)
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long, so long
So long
(Jesus walks with me)
To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers
(Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare for we living in hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models, we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God, my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screaming out
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walks with me, with me, with me)
The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now
