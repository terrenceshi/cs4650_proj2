For the first time, Thomas thought Chuck’s personality had gone from mildly irritating to intolerable.
“Chuck, be glad I’mnot holding Alby’s bow right about now.”
“I’mjust play—”
“Shut up, Chuck. Go to sleep.” Thomas just couldn’t handle it right then.
Eventually, his “buddy” did doze off, and based on the rumble of snores across the Glade, so did
everyone else. Hours later, deep in the night, Thomas was still the only one awake. He wanted to cry, but
didn’t. He wanted to find Alby and punch him, for no reason whatsoever, but didn’t. He wanted to scream
and kick and spit and open up the Box and jump into the blackness below. But he didn’t.
He closed his eyes and forced the thoughts and dark images away and at some point he fell asleep.

Chuck had to drag Thomas out of his sleeping bag in the morning, drag him to the showers, and drag him
to the dressing rooms. The whole time, Thomas felt mopey and indifferent, his head aching, his body
wanting more sleep. Breakfast was a blur, and an hour after it was over, Thomas couldn’t remember what
he’d eaten. He was so tired, his brain felt like someone had gone in and stapled it to his skull in a dozen
places. Heartburn ravaged his chest.
But fromwhat he could tell, naps were frowned upon in the giant working farmof the Glade.
He stood with Newt in front of the barn of the Blood House, getting ready for his first training session
with a Keeper. Despite the rough morning, he was actually excited to learn more, and for the chance to get
his mind off Ben and the graveyard. Cows mooed, sheep bleated, pigs squealed all around him.
Somewhere close by, a dog barked, making Thomas hope Frypan didn’t bring new meaning to the word
hot dog. Hot dog, he thought. When’s the last time I had a hot dog? Who did I eat it with?
