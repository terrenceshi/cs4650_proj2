“Dear, please,” Gran told me, “the inspector is only doing
his job.”
“Badly!” I said.
“Let’s all have some tea,” Gran suggested.
“No!” Carter and I yelled at once, which made me feel
bad for Gran, as she practically wilted into the sofa.
“We can charge you,” the inspector warned, turning on
me. “We can and we will—”
He froze. Then he blinked several times, as if he’d
forgotten what he was doing.
Gramps frowned. “Er, Inspector?”
“Yes…” Chief Inspector Williams murmured dreamily.
He reached in his pocket and took out a little blue booklet—an
American passport. He threw it in Carter’s lap.
“You’re being deported,” the inspector announced.
“You’re to leave the country within twenty-four hours. If we
need to question you further, you’ll be contacted through the
FBI.”
Carter’s mouth fell open. He looked at me, and I knew I
wasn’t imagining how odd this was. The inspector had
completely changed direction. He’d been about to arrest us. I
was sure of it. And then out of the blue, he was deporting
Carter? Even the other police officers looked confused.
