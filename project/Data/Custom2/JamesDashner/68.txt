They only made it about three miles before it got too dark to
continue. And Mark was more than ready to stop, exhausted from
the crazy day. Alec had to have known they couldn’t go far, but
staying in that village was not an option. They were nally gone

insisted they keep their distance from each other, so Mark lay on his

wishing they could cuddle, at least. Mark almost scooted over to her
about a hundred times but stopped himself. He knew she wouldn’t
let him, anyway. They didn’t say much, just held each other’s gaze.

friends who’d survived the trek of horror they’d made—from the
devastation that was New York City to the Appalachian Mountains.
