Mark straightened up and moved a few feet away. He couldn’t
believe he’d handled the box. He might even have opened it if he
hadn’t brought it into the light rst. For all he knew, those darts
had broken during the ight of the Berg. Maybe the virus had even
seeped through the small cracks in the container. Not to mention
there were open boxes on the shelves, though they appeared to be
empty.
He wiped his hands on his pants, stepped away even farther.
Clang. Clang. Clang.
Alec stopped, breathing heavily. “One or two more whacks and I
think this baby will bust open. We need to be ready. Find any
weapons?”
Mark felt sick. As if microscopic bugs had leapt from the box to
his skin and were burrowing their way to his blood even as he stood
there. “No, just a box holding darts lled with a deadly virus.
Maybe we can throw some at them?” It was meant as a joke but
somehow made him feel even worse as the words came out.
“What? A virus?” Alec repeated in a doubtful tone. He walked
over and peered down at the box on the oor. “I’ll be … So that’s
what they were shooting at us? Who are these people?”
Mark panicked. “What if they’re waiting on the other side of that
door?” he asked. “Waiting to put darts in our necks? What are we
even doing up here?” He could hear the rising alarm in his own
voice and was ashamed of it.
