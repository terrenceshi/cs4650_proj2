Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
"Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
And some things you just can't speak about
With you, I serve
With you, I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathing out, out
Something med school did not cover
Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
"Doc, I think she's crashing out"
And some things you just can't speak about
Only 20 minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen
With you, I serve
With you, I fall down, down (down)
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathing out, out
With you, I serve
With you, I fall down (down), down (down)
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathing out (out), out
Only 20 minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen
