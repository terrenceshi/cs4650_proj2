Newt shook his head back and forth, staring at the ground. Then he looked up, took in the other
Keepers. “The Creators—those shanks did this to us, not Tommy and Teresa. The Creators. And they’ll
be sorry.”
“Whatever,” Minho said, “who gives a klunk about all that—just get on with the escape already.”
A lump formed in Thomas’s throat. He was so relieved he almost couldn’t speak. He’d been sure
they’d put him under major heat for his confession, if not throw him off the Cliff. The rest of what he had
to say almost seemed easy now. “There’s a computer station in a place we’ve never looked before. The
code will open a door for us to get out of the Maze. It also shuts down the Grievers so they can’t follow
us—if we can just survive long enough to get to that point.”
“A place we’ve never looked before?” Alby asked. “What do you think we’ve been doing for two
years?”
“Trust me, you’ve never been to this spot.”
Minho stood up. “Well, where is it?”
“It’s almost suicide,” Thomas said, knowing he was putting off the answer. “The Grievers will come
after us whenever we try to do it. All of them. The final test.” He wanted to make sure they understood the
stakes. The odds of everyone surviving were slim.
“So where is it?” Newt asked, leaning forward in his chair.
“Over the Cliff,” Thomas answered. “We have to go through the Griever Hole.”
