As if the thought must be made real, a body bumps into Mark’s
knee, then whips past in the river—a woman. Her face is the blue of
death, framed by a oating mat of hair. She spins slowly as she
rushes deeper into the black tunnel beyond. Then there are more.
Some alive, most unmoving—probably dead, Mark realizes. The
living are ailing their arms and legs, trying to swim or gain
purchase on the ground. Mark has the eeting thought that they
should try to help them, reach for their hands. But it’s too late—
they’ll be lucky to get themselves out.
Alec has reached the stairs, has grabbed the iron railing, takes two
steps up. Mark moves another sluggish step forward; the water is up
to his waist now. Burning, roasting. Alec leans down and helps Lana
up the stairs. Then Trina makes it, grabs his hand. Up she goes.
Mark is next. He takes the last tremulous step and he’s suddenly
clasping forearms with the old man who keeps saving his life. His
body jolts forward as Alec pulls him hard and he’s on the stairs,
almost falling forward onto his face. Trina catches him, hugs him.
The Toad makes it, then Darnell, then Misty. All of them but Alec
up the short ight of stairs and onto the landing, grouping together
in front of the door. The younger boy, Baxter, is struggling. Mark’s
suddenly struck by shame as he realizes the kid’s still out there—
he’s six feet beyond Alec’s reach, the water slamming into his side,
rising and rising, splashing up into his frightened face.
Mark runs back down the stairs even as Trina is calling his name.
He stands next to Alec, wonders what to do. Bodies are shooting
past Baxter; Mark sees a stray foot smack the kid in the shoulder. A
head bobs up out of the river right next to him, spewing water, then
disappears back under
