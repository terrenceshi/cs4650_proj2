They reach the landing of the fth oor and Trina is waiting at the
door to the stairwell.
“Hurry!” she says, motioning with a quick nod to follow her. She
breaks into a trot and talks over her shoulder as they maneuver
down a long hallway toward the outermost wall of windows. “It’s a
big yacht—looks like it was nice and fancy before the ares struck.
Now it seems like it was built a hundred years ago. Can’t believe it
oats, much less runs.”
“Could you see the people on it yet?” Mark asks.
“No. They’re obviously underneath. In the cockpit, the bridge,
whatever you call it.”
Seems like she knows as much about boats as Mark.
They turn a corner and see Alec and Lana at a section where the
windows have been knocked out, the water of the sea lapping
against the wall just a foot or so below them outside. The Toad and
Misty are sitting on the oor, staring out. Mark hears the boat
before he sees it, a coughing, choked sound of engines that have
seen better days. Then the battered vessel comes into view past a
small building, its back end sunk low into the water as the yacht
chugs along. It’s about thirty feet long, fteen wide, with duct tape
and plywood boards covering up scattered holes and split seams. A
tinted window with spiderwebs of cracks is like an ominous eye,
looking at them as it approaches.
“Do they know we’re here?” Mark asks. He only allows himself to
think that these people are coming to rescue them. Bring food and
water, at least. “Did you hail them down?”
