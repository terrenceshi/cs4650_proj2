“The river is treacherous,” he told me in a familiar voice.
“A pilot cannot get distracted. He must always be alert for
sandbars and hidden snags. That’s why boats are painted with
my eyes, you know—to see the dangers.”
“The Eyes of Horus,” I said. “You.”
The falcon god glanced at me, and I saw that his eyes
were two different colors—one blazing yellow like the sun,
the other reflective silver like the moon. The effect was so
disorienting, I had to look away. And when I did, I noticed that
Horus’s shadow didn’t match his form. Stretched across the
wheelhouse was the silhouette of a giant falcon.
“You wonder if order is better than chaos,” he said. “You
become distracted from our real enemy: Set. You should be
taught a lesson.”
I was about to say, No really, that’s okay.
But immediately my ba was whisked away. Suddenly, I
was on board an airplane—a big international aircraft like
planes my dad and I had taken a million times. Zia Rashid,
Desjardins, and two other magicians were scrunched up in a
middle row, surrounded by families with screaming children.
Zia didn’t seem to mind. She meditated calmly with her eyes
closed, while Desjardins and the other two men looked so
uncomfortable, I almost wanted to laugh.
