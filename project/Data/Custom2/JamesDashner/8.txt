He couldn’t believe how quickly the light disappeared. From the Glade proper, the forest didn’t look that
big, maybe a couple of acres. Yet the trees were tall with sturdy trunks, packed tightly together, the
canopy up above thick with leaves. The air around him had a greenish, muted hue, as if only several
minutes of twilight remained in the day.
It was somehow beautiful and creepy, all at once.
Moving as fast as he could, Thomas crashed through the heavy foliage, thin branches slapping at his
face. He ducked to avoid a low-hanging limb, almost falling. Reaching out, he caught hold of a branch and
swung himself forward to regain his balance. A thick bed of leaves and fallen twigs crunched underneath
him.
All the while, his eyes stayed riveted on the beetle blade scuttling across the forest floor. Deeper it
went, its red light glowing brighter as the surroundings darkened.
Thomas had charged thirty or forty feet into the woods, dodging and ducking and losing ground with
every second, when the beetle blade jumped onto a particularly large tree and scooted up its trunk. But by
the time Thomas reached the tree, any sign of the creature had vanished. It had disappeared deep within
the foliage—almost as if it had never existed.
He’d lost the sucker.
“Shuck it,” Thomas whispered, almost as a joke. Almost. As strange as it seemed, the word felt natural
on his lips, like he was already morphing into a Glader.
A twig snapped somewhere to his right and he jerked his head in that direction. He stilled his breath,
listened.
