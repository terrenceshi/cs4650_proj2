By Thomas’s watch, it was midmorning when he and Minho stepped through the West Door back into the
Glade. Thomas was so tired he wanted to lie down right there and take a nap. They’d been in the Maze for
roughly twenty-four hours.
Surprisingly, despite the dead light and everything falling apart, the day in the Glade appeared to be
proceeding business as usual—farming, gardening, cleaning. It didn’t take long for some of the boys to
notice themstanding there. Newt was notified and he came running.
“You’re the first to come back,” he said as he walked up to them. “What happened?” The childlike look
of hope on his face broke Thomas’s heart—he obviously thought they’d found something important. “Tell
me you’ve got good news.”
Minho’s eyes were dead, staring at a spot somewhere in the gray distance. “Nothing,” he said. “The
Maze is a big freaking joke.”
Newt looked at Thomas, confused. “What’s he talking about?”
“He’s just discouraged,” Thomas said with a weary shrug. “We didn’t find anything different. The
walls haven’t moved, no exits, nothing. Did the Grievers come last night?”
Newt paused, darkness passing over his face. Finally, he nodded. “Yeah. They took Adam.”
Thomas didn’t know the name, and felt guilty for feeling nothing. Just one person again, he thought.
Maybe Gally was right.
Newt was about to say something else when Minho freaked out, startling Thomas.
“I’msick of this!” Minho spat in the ivy, veins popping out of his neck. “I’msick of it! It’s over! It’s all
over!” He took off his backpack and threw it on the ground. “There’s no exit, never was, never will be.
We’re all shucked.”
Thomas watched, his throat dry, as Minho stomped off toward the Homestead. It worried him—if
Minho gave up, they were all in big trouble.
Newt didn’t say a word. He left Thomas standing there, now in his own daze. Despair hung in the air
like the smoke fromthe Map Room, thick and acrid.
