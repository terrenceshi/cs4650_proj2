I was used to the occasional weird experience, but usually they were over quickly. This twenty-
four/seven hallucination was more than I could handle. For the rest of the school year, the entire

campus seemed to be playing some kind of trick on me. The students acted as if they were
completely and totally convinced that Mrs. Kerr—a perky blond woman whom I'd never seen in
my life until she got on our bus at the end of the field trip—had been our pre-algebra teacher
since Christmas.
Every so often I would spring a Mrs. Dodds reference on somebody, just to see if I could trip
them up, but they would stare at me like I was psycho.
It got so I almost believed them—Mrs. Dodds had never existed.
Almost.

But Grover couldn't fool me. When I mentioned the name Dodds to him, he would hesitate,
then claim she didn't exist. But I knew he was lying.
Something was going on. Something had happened at the museum.
I didn't have much time to think about it during the days, but at night, visions of Mrs. Dodds
with talons and leathery wings would wake me up in a cold sweat.
The freak weather continued, which didn't help my mood. One night, a thunderstorm blew
out the windows in my dorm room. A few days later, the biggest tornado ever spotted in the
Hudson Valley touched down only fifty miles from Yancy Academy. One of the current events
we studied in social studies class was the unusual number of small planes that had gone down in
sudden squalls in the Atlantic that year.
I started feeling cranky and irritable most of the time. My grades slipped from Ds to Fs. I got
into more fights with Nancy Bobofit and her friends. I was sent out into the hallway in almost
every class.
Finally, when our English teacher, Mr. Nicoll, asked me for the millionth time why I was too
lazy to study for spelling tests, I snapped. I called him an old sot. I wasn't even sure what it
meant, but it sounded good.
