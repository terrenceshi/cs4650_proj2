All I could think of was that the teachers must've found the illegal stash of candy I'd been
selling out of my dorm room. Or maybe they'd realized I got my essay on Tom Sawyer from the
Internet without ever reading the book and now they were going to take away my grade. Or
worse, they were going to make me read the book.
"Well?" she demanded.
"Ma'am, I don't..."
"Your time is up," she hissed.
Then the weirdest thing happened. Her eyes began to glow like barbecue coals. Her fingers
stretched, turning into talons. Her jacket melted into large, leathery wings. She wasn't human. She
was a shriveled hag with bat wings and claws and a mouth full of yellow fangs, and she was
about to slice me to ribbons.
Then things got even stranger.
Mr. Brunner, who'd been out in front of the museum a minute before, wheeled his chair into
the doorway of the gallery, holding a pen in his hand.
"What ho, Percy!" he shouted, and tossed the pen through the air.
Mrs. Dodds lunged at me.
With a yelp, I dodged and felt talons slash the air next to my ear. I snatched the ballpoint pen
out of the air, but when it hit my hand, it wasn't a pen anymore. It was a swordâ€”Mr. Brunner's
bronze sword, which he always used on tournament day.
Mrs. Dodds spun toward me with a murderous look in her eyes.
My knees were jelly. My hands were shaking so bad I almost dropped the sword.
She snarled, "Die, honey!"
And she flew straight at me.
Absolute terror ran through my body. I did the only thing that came naturally: I swung the
sword.
The metal blade hit her shoulder and passed clean through her body as if she were made of
water. Hisss!
