“You’re sure?” he asked my mother. “Absolutely sure?”
Mum brushed her blond hair out of her face. She was
even more beautiful than her pictures, but she looked worried
—eyebrows furrowed, lips pressed together. Like me when I
was upset, when I looked in the mirror and tried to convince
myself things weren’t so bad. I wanted to call to her, to let her
know I was there, but my voice wouldn’t work.
“She told me this is where it begins,” my mother said.
She pulled her black coat around her, and I caught a glimpse
of her necklace—the amulet of Isis, my amulet. I stared at it,
stunned, but then she pulled her collar closed, and the amulet
disappeared. “If we want to defeat the enemy, we must start
with the obelisk. We must find out the truth.”
My father frowned uneasily. He’d drawn a protective
circle around them—blue chalk lines on the pavement. When
he touched the base of the obelisk, the circle began to glow.
“I don’t like it,” he said. “Won’t you call on her help?”
“No,” my mother insisted. “I know my limits, Julius. If I
tried it again…”
My heart skipped a beat. Iskandar’s words came back to
me: She saw things that made her seek advice from
unconventional places. I recognized the look in my mother’s
eyes, and I knew: my mother had communed with Isis.
