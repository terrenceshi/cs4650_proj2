"Maybe next time," I said. "Thank you for—" I looked down at the burned cookies scattered on the

She tried to stop us, to offer us Kool-Aid, but I had to get out of that house. On the front porch, she
grabbed my wrist and I almost jumped out of my skin. "Luke, at least be safe. Promise me you'll be safe."
"I will . . . Mom."
That made her smile. She released my wrist, and as she closed the front door I could hear her talking

Back at the cliff, Mrs. O'Leary had found a friend.
A cozy campfire crackled in a ring of stones. A girl about eight years old was sitting cross-legged

After staring at moldy peanut butter sandwiches and burned cookies, I didn't have much of an
appetite, but the girl waved her hand and a picnic appeared at the edge of the fire. There were plates of
roast beef, baked potatoes, buttered carrots, fresh bread, and a whole bunch of other foods I hadn't had in
