Newt laughed, a sound Thomas realized he hadn’t heard much since he’d arrived. “We always make
the Newbies start with the bloody Slicers. Don’t worry, cuttin’ up Frypan’s victuals ain’t but a part.
Slicers do anything and everything dealin’ with the beasties.”
“Too bad I can’t remember my whole life. Maybe I love killing animals.” He was just joking, but Newt
didn’t seemto get it.
Newt nodded toward the barn. “Oh, you’ll know good and well by the time sun sets tonight. Let’s go
meet Winston—he’s the Keeper.”
Winston was an acne-covered kid, short but muscular, and it seemed to Thomas the Keeper liked his
job way too much. Maybe he was sent here for being a serial killer, he thought.
Winston showed Thomas around for the first hour, pointing out which pens held which animals, where
the chicken and turkey coops were, what went where in the barn. The dog, a pesky black Lab named Bark,
took quickly to Thomas, hanging at his feet the entire tour. Wondering where the dog came from, Thomas
asked Winston, who said Bark had just always been there. Luckily, he seemed to have gotten his name as
a joke, because he was pretty quiet.
The second hour was spent actually working with the farm animals—feeding, cleaning, fixing a fence,
scraping up klunk. Klunk. Thomas found himself using the Glader terms more and more.
The third hour was the hardest for Thomas. He had to watch as Winston slaughtered a hog and began
preparing its many parts for future eating. Thomas swore two things to himself as he walked away for
lunch break. First, his career would not be with the animals; second, he’d never again eat something that
came out of a pig.
