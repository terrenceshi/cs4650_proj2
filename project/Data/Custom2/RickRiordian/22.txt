I turned away as the god Ares revealed his true irnmortal form. I somehow knew that if I
looked, I would disintegrate into ashes.
The light died.
I looked back. Ares was gone. The tide rolled out to reveal Hades's bronze helm of darkness.
I picked it up and walked toward my friends.
But before I got there, I heard the flapping of leathery wings. Three evil-looking
grandmothers with lace hats and fiery whips drifted down from the sky and landed in front of me.
The middle Fury, the one who had been Mrs. Dodds, stepped forward. Her fangs were bared,
but for once she didn't look threatening. She looked more disappointed, as if she'd been planning
to have me for supper, but had decided I might give her indigestion.
"We saw the whole thing," she hissed. "So ... it truly was not you?"
I tossed her the helmet, which she caught in surprise.
"Return that to Lord Hades," I said. "Tell him the truth. Tell him to call off the war."
She hesitated, then ran a forked tongue over her green, leathery lips. "Live well, Percy
Jackson. Become a true hero. Because if you do not, if you ever come into my clutches again ..."
She cackled, savoring the idea. Then she and her sisters rose on their bats' wings, fluttered
into the smoke-filled sky, and disappeared.
I joined Grover and Annabeth, who were staring at me in amazement.
