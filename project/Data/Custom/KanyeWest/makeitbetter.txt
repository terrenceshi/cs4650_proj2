("Make It Up") We can make it better
("Make It Up") We can make it better
("Make It Up") We can make it better
("Make It Up") We can make it

Somebody told me that Delta's brownskinned, AKAs' lightskinned
And they supposed to be bourgeois, so they got white friends
First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein'
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said, "I know what you about to say, like your hypeman"
She let a nigga hit it, and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightnin'; but

("Make It Up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Make It Up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Make It Up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Make It Up") We can make it

The night fallin' over Brooklyn, where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drugdealer priestess
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
Kweli the truth, like I'm comin' out the mouth of bass
One for in and one for out the grave
Niggaz want they reparations, How you calculate the amount to be paid
You try to imagine America without the slaves (the slaves)

Her tenament yo, is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold boullion cause she wouldn't protest it
Cause, her bestfriend's man got popped
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a glock
In the hood is a everday happenin'
In front of the precinct she choose out the captain
She yelled out "Why you do this to black men?"

I think of eighty seven ways, to make better days
Whether climb or rhyme, I heard that rebel pays
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
Music, ridin' it good like escalades
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
And niggaz wit' thangs ain't afraid of karma
I'm thinkin' big like Little Wayne in the carter

C'mon; Tell people the truth, but never give 'em ya true thoughts
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our youth
Partiot Act in effect, make it hard to breathe now
Johnny Cochran dead, who gonna get us free now?
Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now?
Who gon' make it better for the thugs and P's now?
Who gon' make it good for old folks that's senile?
Oh, it's good music, yeah dog I see now
