Even blocks away in the dark, Katherine could see the trees—four huge palms, much too tall for Oakland.
They made her think of Los Angeles—trips to visit the Reyes side of the family every other Christmas, her father
always looking for excuses not to go, her mother tossing dishes and slamming pots around the kitchen until he
agreed.
Katherine used to think a lot about L.A., about escaping, moving in with her cousins. Her cousins knew how to
have fun. They knew the best Spanish cuss words and where to score dope. Their fathers weren't goddamn teachers.
But running away wasn't a fantasy she believed in anymore.
Katherine curbed the Toyota in front of the house. She stared up at the night sky, a few stars peeking through the
mist and the palm fronds. The palm trees would die tonight. As huge as they were, they weren't designed to
withstand this kind of cold. The freeze would turn their insides to mush. It made Katherine sad to know this with
such certainty.
When she was eight, she and her dad had planted morning glories in the backyard, her dad telling her not to get
her hopes up, the San Francisco climate was really too cold for them. But over the course of the summer, the vines
had overgrown their cheap metal trellis and bloomed with a vengeance—red, purple and blue flowers like a mass of
alien eyes. Every day they'd crumple, every night they'd reopen.
“Don't they ever die?” Katherine had asked.
Her dad smiled, cupped his fingers gently around her ear. “I don't know, sweetheart. I thought they were
ephemeral. I guess they're not.”
Katherine hadn't known what ephemeral meant. Her dad never explained words, never watered down his
vocabulary. But she liked the sound of it.
Eventually, the weight of the flowers made the trellis collapse. Her father had moved the beautiful, broken heap of
metal and plants to the side of the toolshed, and still the flowers kept blooming for weeks, without their roots, not
realizing they were dead.
