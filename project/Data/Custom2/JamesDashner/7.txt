Any kind of feelin’ you’ve seen her before?”
“No. Nothing.” Thomas shifted, looked down at his feet, then back at the girl.
Alby’s forehead creased. “You’re sure?” He looked like he didn’t believe a word Thomas said,
seemed almost angry.
What could he possibly think I have to do with this? Thomas thought. He met Alby’s glare evenly and
answered the only way he knew how. “Yes. Why?”
“Shuck it,” Alby muttered, looking back down at the girl. “Can’t be a coincidence. Two days, two
Greenies, one alive, one dead.”
Then Alby’s words started to make sense and panic flared in Thomas. “You don’t think I ...” He
couldn’t even finish the sentence.
“Slimit, Greenie,” Newt said. “We’re not sayin’ you bloody killed the girl.”
Thomas’s mind was spinning. He was sure he’d never seen her before—but then the slightest hint of
doubt crept into his mind. “I swear she doesn’t look familiar at all,” he said anyway. He’d had enough
accusations.
“Are you—”
Before Newt could finish, the girl shot up into a sitting position. As she sucked in a huge breath, her
eyes snapped open and she blinked, looking around at the crowd surrounding her. Alby cried out and fell
backward. Newt gasped and jumped up, stumbling away from her. Thomas didn’t move, his gaze locked
on the girl, frozen in fear.
Burning blue eyes darted back and forth as she took deep breaths. Her pink lips trembled as she
mumbled something over and over, indecipherable. Then she spoke one sentence—her voice hollow and
haunted, but clear.
