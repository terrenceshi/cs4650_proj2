Eyeball got serious. “We don’t have much time. Since word’s gotten out about their plan, the brothers are planning to strike at midnight — I’ve got me own spies about, you know.”

“How do we know you’re on our side?” Riq asked.

Eyeball looked hurt. “Why in the blazes would I be lettin’ you out if I weren’t? I’m doin’ it mainly for the love I have for Gloria, I tell you. She doesn’t know it quite yet, mind your smarts. But me heart’s been hers ever since I first laid me eye upon the glorious vision of her clobberin’ a cow with that club of hers. Ah, what a woman.”

He touched a hand to his heart. “We figured it best to hide our little cahoots, wantin’ to be safe and all. But I been working with her some months now. And so here I am, at your service. One eye or none, I’m the best you got.”

Sera found herself trusting the man. Why would he let them go now if he wasn’t on their side? Dak and Riq seemed to agree with her by the looks on their faces.

“So, what’re we going to do?” Dak asked. “Should we just smash into the Amancios’ room? Throw them overboard? Stop this thing before it even gets started?”

“Don’t be as stupid as you look,” Eyeball spat. “Do that and we’ll be the ones accused of a mutiny. No, sir — we need to lie low until those turncoat brothers make their move against the captain. Then we come in and save the day. Every slimy-haired runt on this ship will know we’re the heroes then.”

Sera couldn’t hide her worry. “That’s the plan? What if the guards come down and see that we’re gone? What if the Amancios do something bad to Columbus before we can save him? Slit his throat or poison him?”

“What if the moon cracks open and drops lamb chops on us?” Eyeball growled. “What if me legs fall off and start dancin’? We’ll do our best, lad. Or should I say lassie?”
