Damn
Here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn
Here we go again
People talking shit but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
I'll never be picture perfect Beyonc√©
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet
He was black as the street was
I never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summer time like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn
Here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn
Here we go again
People talking shit but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me in barber shops
They forget to get they haircut
Okay, fair enough the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun talk or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reebok's or Adidas
Can I add that he do spazz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP awards
Goodbye to the India Arie awards
They rather give me the n-nigga please award
But I'll just take the I got a lot of cheese award
Damn
Here we go again
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn
Here we go again
People talking shit but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
I know people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
Man killing's some wack shit
Oh I forgot except for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'
He got changed over his chain a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody pastor
The church want tie so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door 'cause I can't afford to stay
My 15 seconds up but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today
Damn
Here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn
Here we go again
People talking shit but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
