Alec lifted the sledgehammer high, then brought it crashing down
against the handle. It took two more hits for the whole thing to
nally break o with a crunch. One more swing and the door swung
open, shooting outward and slamming into the wall on the other
side. Almost immediately three darts cut through the air, swoosh,
swoosh, swoosh, clanging o the far wall. Then there was the sound
of something clattering against the oor, followed by footsteps
running away. Just one person.
Alec held up a hand as if he thought Mark would go charging after
the guy. Then he peeked around the edge of the doorframe.
“All clear. And the rat must’ve run out of darts, because he threw
his gun on the ground. I’m beginning to think this Berg only has a
few people on it. Come on, let’s go catch that weasel.”
Alec leaned out into the open a bit farther, sweeping his gaze back
and forth one last time. Then he moved into the dimly lit area
beyond. Mark took a deep breath and followed him into the
hallway, kicking the dart gun away in disgust. As it clattered across
the room and hit a wall, he pictured Darnell, that dart sticking
straight out of his shoulder. Mark wished he had more than a
wrench in his hands
