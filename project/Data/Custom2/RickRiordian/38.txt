Amy's eyebrows furrowed. "What's it doing in an arsenal?"
"Don't know, but I'm collecting it!" Despite Amy's protests, Dan stuffed the
battery in his backpack. It fit because the pack was pretty much empty. The only
other thing he had in there was the picture of his parents, wrapped in its plastic

A Styrofoam egg carton caught his eye. He opened it and found a single silver
orb with little blinking red lights. "This is cool, too!" He dropped it into his
backpack.
"Dan, no!"
"What? They've got plenty of other stuff, and we need all the help we can get!"
"It could be dangerous."
"I hope so." He was admiring the shurikens and thinking he might take some of
those, too, when a door slammed somewhere down the hall.

"Come on," Amy insisted.
"Now."
