“Okay,” Alec said. “When I saw them, Lana and the others were
being led to a house down there.” He nodded toward the street to
the right. “But I think we should search each one to be sure. If
they’ve been moved, I’d rather not miss them. If we can avoid the
main pack of wackos up the street, all the better.”
“Might as well get started, then,” Mark replied. “Right here.”
Alec nodded. “Come on.”
They slipped out from the protection of the wall and headed for
the front door—only to run straight into a man standing in front of
the entrance. He was dressed in tattered clothing and his face was
dirty, a red gash taking up most of his cheek.
“Get out of the way,” Alec barked. “Step away from the door and
into the yard or you’ll be dead in ve seconds.”
The man gave them a blank look. Then he raised his eyebrows
once and did as he was told, stepping calmly o the porch and
walking—slowly—onto the weedy, rocky front yard. And he kept
walking, without a backward glance, until he reached the sidewalk,
where he turned to the right and headed for the activity down the
road.
Alec shook his head. “Be ready in case someone jumps out at us.”
Mark planted his feet and aimed his weapon.
Alec held his Transvice with one hand and reached out with the
other, grabbing the door and pulling it open. He took a step back as
it swung wide, giving Mark a clear shot if he needed it. But the
place was empty.
