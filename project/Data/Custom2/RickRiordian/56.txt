“Oh, very funny!” I yelled. The scales and the throne
vanished. The linen bench unraveled and dumped me in the
middle of the graveyard. Carter and Khufu appeared next to
me, but I just kept yelling at the spot where Anubis had stood,
calling him some choice names.
“What’s going on?” Carter demanded. “Where are we?”
“He’s horrible!” I growled. “Self-important, sarcastic,
incredibly hot, insufferable—”
“Agh!” Khufu complained.
“Yeah,” Carter agreed. “Did you get the feather or not?”
I held out my hand, and there it was—a glowing white
plume floating above my fingers. I closed my fist and it
disappeared again.
“Whoa,” Carter said. “But what about Anubis? How did
you—”
“Let’s find Bast and get out of here,” I interrupted.
“We’ve got work to do.”
And I marched out of the graveyard before he could ask
me more questions, because I was in no mood to tell the truth.
