Thomas landed against the wall and spun just in time to see the second creature tumble over the edge,
not able to stop itself. The third one planted a heavily spiked arminto the stone, but its momentumwas too
much. The nerve-grinding squeal of the spike cutting through the ground sent a shiver up Thomas’s spine,
though a second later the Griever tumbled into the abyss. Again, neither of them made a sound as they fell
—as if they’d disappeared instead of falling.
The fourth and final approaching creature was able to stop in time, teetering on the very edge of the
cliff, a spike and a claw holding it in place.
Instinctively Thomas knew what he had to do. Looking to Minho, he nodded, then turned. Both boys ran
in at the Griever and jumped feetfirst at the creature, kicking out at the last second with every waning bit
of strength. They both connected, sending the last monster plummeting to its death.
Thomas quickly scrambled to the edge of the abyss, poking his head over to see the falling Grievers.
But impossibly, they were gone—not even a sign of themin the emptiness that stretched below. Nothing.
His mind couldn’t process the thought of where the Cliff led or what had happened to the terrible
creatures. His last ounce of strength disappeared, and he curled into a ball on the ground.
Then, finally, came the tears.
