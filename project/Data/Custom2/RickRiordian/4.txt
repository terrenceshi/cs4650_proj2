I walked downstairs to the faculty offices. Most of them were dark and empty, but Mr.
Brunner's door was ajar, light from his window stretching across the hallway floor.
I was three steps from the door handle when I heard voices inside the office. Mr. Brunner
asked a question. A voice that was definitely Grover's said "... worried about Percy, sir."
I froze.
I'm not usually an eavesdropper, but I dare you to try not listening if you hear your best friend
talking about you to an adult.
I inched closer.
"... alone this summer," Grover was saying. "I mean, a Kindly One in the school! Now that
we know for sure, and they know too—"
"We would only make matters worse by rushing him," Mr. Brunner said. "We need the boy
to mature more."

"But he may not have time. The summer solstice deadline— "
"Will have to be resolved without him, Grover. Let him enjoy his ignorance while he still
can."
"Sir, he saw her... ."
"His imagination," Mr. Brunner insisted. "The Mist over the students and staff will be enough
to convince him of that."
"Sir, I ... I can't fail in my duties again." Grover's voice was choked with emotion. "You
know what that would mean."
"You haven't failed, Grover," Mr. Brunner said kindly. "I should have seen her for what she
was. Now let's just worry about keeping Percy alive until next fall—"
The mythology book dropped out of my hand and hit the floor with a thud.
Mr. Brunner went silent.
My heart hammering, I picked up the book and backed down the hall.
