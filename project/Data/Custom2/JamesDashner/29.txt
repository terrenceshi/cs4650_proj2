“I’m just as worried about the cold,” Sarah said. “Maybe that’s
one of the reasons this game is A.O. Most kids would run out there
and think killing people was all that mattered. We need to make
sure we stop and warm up now and then so we don’t get frostbite.”
Bryson was shaking his head. “That can’t be it. There’s gotta be
something worse out there. A lot worse. It’s hard to get rated A.O.”
Michael agreed completely. They’d all seen plenty of games that
weren’t A.O., and many of those included some truly mentally
scarring experiences. “At least we studied up. Nothing to do but get
started. Find that gateway to the Path.”
“Prepare to freeze your heinies o,” Bryson said as he walked
over and hefted the bar o its rails. He tossed it on the ground,
where it clanged, then rolled to a stop at Sarah’s feet.
“You were born to be a soldier,” she said.
Bryson winked at her, then yanked open the heavy door. A burst
of arctic wind and swirling ice crystals tore through the tunnel. It
was the coldest thing Michael had ever felt in his life.
Bryson yelled something unintelligible, then stepped into the
world of Greenland. Michael and Sarah followed.
