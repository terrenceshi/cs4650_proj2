Ain't no question, if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playin'? I'm sayin'
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothin' I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly driftin' away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winnin', this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy endin' and a new beginnin'
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?
Ain't no question, if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly driftin' away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playin'? I'm sayin'
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missin'
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standin' at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smilin', they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jump shot, runnin' a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World's Game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say hoe 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it
Ain't no question, if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly driftin' away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playin'? I'm sayin'
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, "Take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was lookin' at my resume, feelin' real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sittin' in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is lookin' at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic endin' of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm comin' after whoever who has it
I'm comin' after whoever, who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, it's like that y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls
Ain't no question, if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly driftin' away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playin'? I'm sayin'
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Ayo, I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Countin' up, smokin', one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, runnin' up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dyin', you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it movin', keep grindin'
Keep shinin', to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
Not for nothin' I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly driftin' away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
