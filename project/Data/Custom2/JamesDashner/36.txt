“Help you do what?” Michael asked. “You really think I’d help
you?”
Kaine nodded matter-of-factly, as if the question was nonsense.
“Absolutely. You’ve already done it by making it this far. You have
no choice in the matter.”
“I came here to stop you!” Michael was shouting now. “Lead the
VNS to you!”
Kaine looked amused, if anything, but didn’t respond. His silence
was maddening—all Michael could hear was the crackle of the re,
and it made him even angrier.
“What is it?” Michael yelled, standing up. “Tell me what’s going
on!”
The Tangent’s smile seemed carved into his face. “I told you—
there’s no way you’ll understand until you experience it for
yourself. Which is about to happen, very soon. There’s nothing you
can do to stop it, Michael.”
“I should hack into your coding,” Michael answered. “I could do
it. I could shut you down. Stop you forever.”
“You just continue to prove why I’ve deemed you worthy, boy.
You are a perfect candidate indeed. Would you like to know
something else?”
