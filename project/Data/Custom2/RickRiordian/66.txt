The crew of glowing orbs zipped around the boat, pulling
lines and lowering the gangplank.
Carter looked tired. He wore jeans and a rumpled shirt
with specks of barbecue sauce on it. His hair was wet and flat
on one side as if he’d fallen asleep in the shower.
Walt looked much better—well, really, there was no
contest. He wore his usual sleeveless shirt and workout pants,
and managed a smile for me even though his posture made it
obvious he was in pain. The shen charm on my necklace
seemed to heat up, or perhaps that was just my body
temperature rising.
Zia and I climbed the gangplank. Bloodstained Blade
bowed, which was quite unnerving, as his head could’ve sliced
a watermelon in half.
“Welcome aboard, Lady Kane.” His voice was a metallic
hum from the edge of his frontal blade. “I am at your service.”
