Minho had been right. Soon, Thomas would be the best Runner.
The second thing he learned about himself, as if the night in the Maze hadn’t proved it already, was that
his body was in perfect shape. Just a day earlier he’d been at the end of his strength and sore from top to
bottom. He’d recovered quickly, and ran now with almost no effort, despite nearing the end of his second
hour of running. It didn’t take a math genius to calculate that his speed and time combined meant he’d run
roughly half a marathon by the time he returned to the Glade.
Never before had the sheer size of the Maze truly hit him. Miles and miles and miles. With its walls
that moved, every night, he finally understood why the Maze was so hard to solve. He’d doubted it until
now, wondered how the Runners could be so inept.
On he ran, left and right, straight, on and on. By the time he’d crossed the threshold into the Glade, the
Doors were only minutes away from closing for the night. Exhausted, he headed straight for the
Deadheads, went deep into the forest until he reached the spot where the trees crowded against the
southwest corner. More than anything, he wanted to be alone.
When he could hear only the sounds of distant Glader conversations, as well as faint echoes of bleating
sheep and snorting pigs, his wish was granted; he found the junction of the two giant walls and collapsed
into the corner to rest. No one came, no one bothered him. The south wall eventually moved, closing for
the night; he leaned forward until it stopped. Minutes later, his back once again comfortably pressed
against thick layers of ivy, he fell asleep.
The next morning, someone gently shook himawake.
“Thomas, wake up.” It was Chuck—the kid seemed to be able to find himanywhere.
Groaning, Thomas leaned forward, stretched out his back and arms. A couple of blankets had been
placed over himduring the night—someone playing the Glade Mother.
“What time is it?” he asked.
