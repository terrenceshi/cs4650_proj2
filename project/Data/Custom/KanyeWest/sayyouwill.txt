Why would she make calls out the blue?
Now I'm awake, sleepless in you
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Then play you will
I pray you will
Mrs. "So Fly" crashlands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
One day you will
I pray you will
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool, then lose control
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
You will... you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
If you will
I pray you will
I wish this song would really come true
I admit, I still fantasize about you (about you)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don' say you will
You will... you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Please say you will
For real
I pray you will
