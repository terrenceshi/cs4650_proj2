Mark shined his light and noticed that the group between them
and the door of the chamber was the smaller of the two, maybe
eight people total. At least chance had given them that much. As if
he and Alec were communicating telepathically, they roared and
charged the small group at the same time. They crashed into them,
sending bodies ying and tumbling all over each other. Mark went
ballistic in a t of desperation, kicking and kneeing and swinging
the butt end of his ashlight at anything that moved. Scrambling
and crawling and pushing, twisting away anytime someone tried to
latch on to his limbs or clothes, he moved forward, barreling
through the crowd of people.
Somehow Mark reached the other side, with a free path to the
open door. Alec fought his way through as well, falling with one
last surge but quickly leaping back to his feet. And then they were
both running to the circular opening, climbing through. In seconds
Alec was on the door, pushing to swing it shut. Several arms slipped
through the gap, blocking the door from closing.
“Come help me!” he yelled.
Mark beat at hands and ngers with his ashlight; then Alec
pulled back on the door and pushed it forward again, crushing it
against those still trying to ght their way in. There were yelps and
screams, and several pulled out. But another surge pressed ahead
and almost made Alec topple over.
