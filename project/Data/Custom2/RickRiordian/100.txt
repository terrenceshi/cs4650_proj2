We could see the white flag from half a mile away. It was as big as a soccer field, carried by a thirty-foottall giant with bright blue skin and icy gray hair.
"A Hyperborean," Thalia said. "The giants of the north. It's a bad sign that they sided with Kronos.
They're usually peaceful."
"You've met them?" I said.
"Mmm. There's a big colony in Alberta. You do not want to get into a snowball fight with those
guys."
As the giant got closer, I could see three human-size envoys with him: a half-blood in armor, an
empousa demon with a black dress and flaming hair, and a tall man in a tuxedo. The empousa held the tux
dude's arm, so they looked like a couple on their way to a Broadway show or something—
except for her flaming hair and fangs.
The group walked leisurely toward the Heckscher Playground. The swings and ball courts were
empty. The only sound was the fountain on Umpire Rock.
I looked at Grover. "The tux dude is the Titan?"
He nodded nervously. "He looks like a magician. I hate magicians. They usually have rabbits."
I stared at him. "You're scared of bunnies?"
"Blah-hah-hah! They're big bullies. Always stealing celery from defenseless satyrs!"
Thalia coughed.
"What?" Grover demanded.
"We'll have to work on your bunny phobia later," I said. "Here they come."
The man in the tux stepped forward. He was taller than an average human—about seven feet. His
black hair was tied in a ponytail. Dark round glasses covered his eyes, but what really caught my
attention was the skin on his face. It was covered in scratches, like he'd been attacked by a small animal—
a really, really mad hamster, maybe.
