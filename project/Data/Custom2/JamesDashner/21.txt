Thomas looked away fromhim, back at the approaching monsters—they were only a few feet away. He
gripped his poor excuse for a spear.
We have to stay close together, he told Teresa. Let them do the fighting—we have to get through that
Hole. He felt like a coward, but he knew that any fighting—and any deaths—would be in vain if they
didn’t get that code punched, the door to the Creators opened.
I know, she replied. Stick together.
“Ready!” Minho yelled next to Thomas, raising his barbwire-wrapped club into the air with one hand,
a long silver knife in the other. He pointed the knife at the horde of Grievers; a flash glinted off the blade.
“Now!”
The Keeper ran forward without waiting for a response. Newt went after him, right on his heels, and
then the rest of the Gladers followed, a tight pack of roaring boys charging ahead to a bloody battle,
weapons raised. Thomas held Teresa’s hand, let them all go past, felt them bump him, smelled their
sweat, sensed their terror, waiting for the perfect opportunity to make his own dash.
Just as the first sounds of boys crashing into Grievers filled the air—pierced with screams and roars of
machinery and wood clacking against steel—Chuck ran past Thomas, who quickly reached out and
grabbed his arm.
Chuck stumbled backward, then looked up at Thomas, his eyes so full of fright Thomas felt something
shatter in his heart. In that split second, he’d made a decision.
“Chuck, you’re with me and Teresa.” He said it forcefully, with authority, leaving no roomfor doubt.
Chuck looked ahead at the engaged battle. “But ...” He trailed off, and Thomas knew the boy relished
the idea though he was ashamed to admit it.
