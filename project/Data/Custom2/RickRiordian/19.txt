I took the big stick out of my backpack—a bedpost I'd broken off Crusty's Safari Deluxe floor
model. I held it up, and tried to channel happy dog thoughts toward Cerberus—Alpo
commercials, cute little puppies, fire hydrants. I tried to smile, like I wasn't about to die.
"Hey, Big Fella," I called up. "I bet they don't play with you much."
"GROWWWLLLL!"
"Good boy," I said weakly.
I waved the stick. The dog's middle head followed the movement. The other two heads
trained their eyes on me, completely ignoring the spirits. I had Cerberus's undivided attention. I
wasn't sure that was a good thing.
"Fetch!" I threw the stick into the gloom, a good solid throw. I heard it go ker-sploosh in the
River Styx.
Cerberus glared at me, unimpressed. His eyes were baleful and cold.
So much for the plan.
Cerberus was now making a new kind of growl, deeper down in his three throats.
"Um," Grover said. "Percy?"
"Yeah?"
"I just thought you'd want to know."
"Yeah?"
"Cerberus? He's saying we've got ten seconds to pray to the god of our choice. After that...
well ... he's hungry."
"Wait!" Annabeth said. She started rifling through her pack.
