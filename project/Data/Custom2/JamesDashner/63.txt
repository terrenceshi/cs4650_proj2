A faint light source appeared a few feet ahead, and as they got
closer their surroundings began to come into focus a bit. They
seemed to be in some sort of storage room, with shelves along all
the walls and straps or chain-link doors to keep everything in place.
But at least half of the shelves were empty.
The light was a glowing panel above a squat metal door with bolts
lining its edges.
“I wonder if they locked us in,” Alec said as he nally stood. He
walked over to the door and tried the handle. Sure enough, it
wouldn’t budge.
Mark was relieved to stand up—the oor was hard against his
knees—but his muscles complained as he pulled himself to his feet.
It’d been a while since he’d exerted so much energy, and getting the
tar beaten out of him by a bunch of trees was an absolute rst.
“What’s going on, anyway?” he asked. “What does anyone want
with our little nothing of a village? And shooting us with darts? I
mean, what was that?”
“I wish I knew.” Alec pulled at the door harder, yanking on the
handle, still to no avail. “But those people sure dropped like ies
once those suckers stuck in ’em.” He turned away from the door
with a frustrated look, then put his hands on his hips like an old
lady.
