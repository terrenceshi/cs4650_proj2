I looked down. Rolling about at my feet were two
partially empty bottles of water. One had lipstick on the cap.
The other looked as if it had been chewed on.
“Not thirsty,” I decided.
Liz and Emma murmured agreement. I was surprised they
weren’t absolutely catatonic after the evening’s events, but
then again, they were my mates. I didn’t hang out with weakwilled girls, did I? Even before I discovered magic, it took a
strong constitution and a fair amount of adaptability to be my
friend. [And no comment from you, Carter.]
Police vehicles were blocking Waterloo Bridge, but Bes
swerved around them, jumped the pavement, and kept driving.
The police didn’t even blink.
“Are we invisible?” I asked.
“To most mortals.” Bes belched. “They’re pretty dense,
aren’t they? Present company excepted, et cetera.”
“You’re really a god?” Liz asked.
“Huge,” Bes said. “I’m huge in the world of gods.”
“A huge god of dwarves,” Emma marveled. “You mean
as in Snow White, or—”
“All dwarves.” Bes waved his hands expansively, which
made me a bit nervous as he took both of them off the wheel.
“Egyptians were smart. They honored people who were born
unusual. Dwarves were considered extremely magical. So
yeah, I’m the god of dwarves.”
