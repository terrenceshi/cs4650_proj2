He gave me a duh look, then pointed to either side of the
car. We’d landed between two stone sphinxes standing on
pedestals. They looked like a lot of sphinxes I’d seen—with
crowned human heads on lion bodies—but I’d never seen
sphinxes covered in snow.
“Are those authentic?” I asked.
“Farthest-north Egyptian artifacts in the world,” Bes said.
“Pillaged from Thebes and brought up here to decorate
Russia’s new imperial city, St. Petersburg. Like I said, every
new empire wants a piece of Egypt.”
The kids outside were still shouting and banging on the
car. One smashed a bottle against our windshield.
“Um,” Sadie said, “should we move?”
“Nah,” Bes said. “Russian kids always hang out by the
sphinxes. Been doing it for hundreds of years.”
“But it’s like midnight here,” I said. “And it’s snowing.”
“Did I mention they’re Russian?” Bes said. “Don’t worry.
I’ll take care of it.”
He opened his door. Glacier-cold wind swept into the
Mercedes, but Bes stepped out wearing nothing but his
Speedo. The kids backed up quickly. I couldn’t blame them.
Bes said something in Russian, then roared like a lion. The
kids screamed and ran.
