Amy could've lived in the secret library. Instead, she almost died there.
She led the way down the steps and gasped when she saw all the books. They
went on forever. She used to think the main public library on Copley Square was
the best in the world, but this was even better. It seemed more
library-ish.
The shelves were dark wood, and the books were leather-bound and very old,
with gilded titles on the spines. They looked like they'd been well-used over the
centuries.
Oriental carpet covered the floor. Cushy chairs were spaced around the room so
you could plop down anywhere and start reading. Maps and oversize folios were
spread out on big tables. Against one wall was a line of oak file cabinets and a
huge computer with three separate monitors, like something they'd use at NASA.
Glass chandeliers hung from the vaulted ceiling and provided plenty of light,
even though the room was obviously underground. They'd descended a long way
to get here, and there were no windows.
