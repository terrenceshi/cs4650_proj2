If you’re hearing this story, you’re already in danger.
Sadie and I might be your only chance.
Go to the school. Find the locker. I won’t tell you which
school or which locker, because if you’re the right person,
you’ll find it. The combination is 13/32/33. By the time you
finish listening, you’ll know what those numbers mean. Just
remember the story we’re about to tell you isn’t complete yet.
How it ends will depend on you.
The most important thing: when you open the package
and find what’s inside, don’t keep it longer than a week. Sure,
it’ll be tempting. I mean, it will grant you almost unlimited
power. But if you possess it too long, it will consume you.
Learn its secrets quickly and pass it on. Hide it for the next
person, the way Sadie and I did for you. Then be prepared for
your life to get very interesting.
Okay, Sadie is telling me to stop stalling and get on with
the story. Fine. I guess it started in London, the night our dad
blew up the British Museum.
My name is Carter Kane. I’m fourteen and my home is a
suitcase.
