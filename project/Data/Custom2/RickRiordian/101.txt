Ethan frowned. He clasped his hand as if he were holding a blade, and mimed a thrust. "I'm not sure,
sir. It all happened so fast. I wasn't aiming for any spot in particular.'
Kronos's fingers tapped the blade of his scythe. "I see," he said in a chilly tone. "If your memory
improves, I will expect—"
Suddenly the Titan lord winced. The giant in the corner unfroze and the french fry fell into his mouth.
Kronos stumbled backward and sank into his throne.
"My lord?" Ethan started forward.
"I—" The voice was weak, but just for a moment it was Luke's. Then Kronos's expression hardened.
He raised his hand and flexed his fingers slowly as if forcing them to obey.
"It is nothing," he said, his voice steely and cold again. "A minor discomfort."
Ethan moistened his lips. "He's still fighting you, isn't he? Luke—"
"Nonsense," Kronos spat. "Repeat that lie, and I will cut out your tongue. The boy's soul has been
crushed. I am simply adjusting to the limits of this form. It requires rest. It is annoying, but no more than
a temporary inconvenience."
"As . . . as you say, my lord."
"You!" Kronos pointed his scythe at a dracaena with green armor and a green crown. "Queen Sess, is
it?"
"Yesssss, my lord."
"Is our little surprise ready to be unleashed?"
The dracaena queen bared her fangs. "Oh, yessss, my lord. Quite a lovely sssssurprissse."
"Excellent," Kronos said. "Tell my brother Hyperion to move our main force south into Central Park.
The half-bloods will be in such disarray they will not be able to defend themselves. Go now, Ethan. Work
on improving your memory. We will talk again when we have taken Manhattan."
