"You were the thief on the winter solstice," he said. "Your father thought to keep you his little
secret. He directed you into the throne room on Olympus, You took the master bolt and my helm.
Had I not sent my Fury to discover you at Yancy Academy, Poseidon might have succeeded in
hiding his scheme to start a war. But now you have been forced into the open. You will be
exposed as Poseidon's thief, and I will have my helm back!"
"But ..." Annabeth spoke. I could tell her mind was going a million miles an hour. "Lord
Hades, your helm of darkness is missing, too?"
"Do not play innocent with me, girl. You and the satyr have been helping this hero—coming
here to threaten me in Poseidon's name, no doubt—to bring me an ultimatum. Does Poseidon
think I can be blackmailed into supporting him?"
"No!" I said. "Poseidon didn't—I didn't—"
"I have said nothing of the helm's disappearance," Hades snarled, "because I had no illusions
that anyone on Olympus would offer me the slightest justice, the slightest help. I can ill afford for
word to get out that my most powerful weapon of fear is missing. So I searched for you myself,
and when it was clear you were coming to me to deliver your threat, I did not try to stop you."
"You didn't try to stop us? But—"
"Return my helm now, or I will stop death," Hades threatened. "That is my counterproposal. I
will open the earth and have the dead pour back into the world. I will make your lands a
nightmare. And you, Percy Jackson—your skeleton will lead my army out of Hades."
