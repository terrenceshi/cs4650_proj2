The end of the world started when a pegasus landed on the hood of my car.
Up until then, I was having a great afternoon. Technically I wasn't supposed to be driving
because I wouldn't turn sixteen for another week, but my mom and my stepdad, Paul, took my
friend Rachel and me to this private stretch of beach on the South Shore, and Paul let us borrow
his Prius for a short spin.
Now, I know you're thinking, Wow, that was really irresponsible of him, blah, blah, blah, but Paul
knows me pretty well. He's seen me slice up demons and leap out of exploding school buildings, so he
probably figured taking a car a few hundred yards wasn't exactly the most dangerous thing I'd ever done.
Anyway, Rachel and I were driving along. It was a hot August day. Rachel's red hair was pulled back
in a ponytail and she wore a white blouse over her swimsuit. I'd never seen her in anything but ratty Tshirts and paint-splattered jeans before, and she looked like a million golden drachmas.
"Oh, pull up right there!" she told me.
We parked on a ridge overlooking the Atlantic. The sea is always one of my favorite places, but
today it was especially niceâ€”glittery green and smooth as glass, as though my dad was keeping it calm
just for us.
My dad, by the way, is Poseidon. He can do stuff like that.
"So." Rachel smiled at me. "About that invitation."
"Oh . . . right." I tried to sound excited. I mean, she'd asked me to her family's vacation house on St.
Thomas for three days. I didn't get a lot of offers like that. My family's idea of a fancy vacation was a
weekend in a rundown cabin on Long Island with some movie rentals and a couple of frozen pizzas, and
here Rachel's folks were willing to let me tag along to the Caribbean.
