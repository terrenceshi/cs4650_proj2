He had decided Norma deserved the truth, even if it destroyed them. But that had been at a distance of two
thousand miles. Now, getting too close, the feeling was like a computer photo. Expand it too much, and it turned
into pixels of random color.
He shucked his tuxedo coat, walked down the hallway to Katherine's room, Norma calling from behind, “I've
already grounded her, Chadwick. Don't make it worse.”
Katherine was on her bed, her back to the wall, her knees up to her chin—prepared for the assault. The
Guatemalan fabric had fallen off her headboard, revealing the decorations Chadwick had painted when Katherine
was two—rainbows and stars, a baby-blue cow jumping over a beaming moon. Kurt Cobain's picture sagged off the
wall above, where Babar the Elephant used to be.
Sadness twisted into Chadwick's chest like a corkscrew. How the hell had Katherine turned sixteen? What
happened to six? What happened to ten?
He tried to see something of himself in her, but Norma had dominated their daughter's genes completely.
Katherine had her mother's fiery eyes, her defiant pout. She had the coffee skin, the lush black hair, the build that
was both petite and combat-sturdy. As a child, Katherine would clench her fists and lock her knees and she'd be
impossible to pick up—as if she were molded from stone.
“Heroin,” Chadwick said.
She rubbed her silver necklace back and forth over her lips, like a zipper. “I told Mom. It wasn't mine.”
“You went back.” Chadwick tried to keep his voice even. “After everything we talked about.”
“Daddy, look, a friend asked me to keep the stuff. A friend from school.”
“Who?”
“It doesn't matter. It's over. Okay? I didn't want to piss him off. I was going to throw the stuff away, give it back,
whatever. I didn't have time. Happy?”
Chadwick needed to believe her. He needed to so badly her words gained substance the more he thought about
them, began to harden into a viable foundation. But goddamn it. After last Saturday . . .
