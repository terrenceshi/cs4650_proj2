I need to call it off
I need to, I need to make it known
'Nother one, something gone, Capricorn
Dancing out on the lawn
Fancy like the things she likes
She lives her life, I'm living mine
All dem a gwaan, dem a, dem a, dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan, gwaan, gwa-gwa-gwaan, soft-soft-soft, soft-soft
All dem a gwaan, dem a, dem a, dem a gwaan, gwaan, gwaan, gwa-gwaan softer than clay
Maybe it's cause
She into Leos and I was into trios
Plus all the trips to Rio couldn't have helped
It's getting cold better bring your ski clothes
Peekin' through the keyhole, the door locked by myself
And I'm feelin' it right now
Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa
On to the next saga
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her
Star Wars fur, yeah I'm rockin' Chewbacca
The one Chief Rocka, number one Chief Rocka oh
All dem a gwaan, dem a, dem a, dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan, gwaan, gwa-gwa-gwaan, soft-soft-soft, soft-soft
All dem a gwaan, dem a, dem a, dem a gwaan, gwaan, gwaan, gwa-gwaan softer than clay
All dem a gwaan, dem a, dem a, dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan, gwaan, gwa-gwa-gwaan, soft-soft-soft, soft-soft
Nun a dem have di guts to rise it and spray
Nun a dem have di guts to bust the SK
Oh, oh, oh
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go, hmmm
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
Let me go, hmmm
All dem a gwaan, dem a, dem a, dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan, gwaan, gwa-gwa-gwaan, soft-soft-soft, soft-soft
All dem a gwaan, dem a, dem a, dem a gwaan, gwaan, gwaan, gwa-gwaan softer than clay
All dem a gwaan, dem a, dem a, dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan, gwaan, gwa-gwa-gwaan, soft-soft-soft, soft-soft
Nun a dem have di guts to rise it and spray
Nun a dem have di guts to bust the SK
