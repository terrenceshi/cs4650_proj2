Amy knew something was wrong as soon as Nellie came out of the rental car
place.
She was frowning and holding a thick brown padded envelope. "What is that?"
Amy asked.
"It's for you guys." Nellie held out the package. "Somebody dropped it off at the
counter this morning."
"That's impossible!" Amy said. "Nobody knew we'd be here."
But as she said it, a chill went down her back. They'd booked the train tickets
and the rental car online last night from their hotel, using Nellie's name. Was it
possible somebody had tracked them down so fast?
"What does the envelope say?" Dan asked.
"'For A. & D. Cahill,'" Nellie read. '"From W. McIntyre.'"
"Mr. McIntyre!" Dan grabbed the package.
"Wait!" Amy yelled. "It could be a trap."
Dan rolled his eyes. "C'mon. It's from -- "
"It could be from anybody," Amy insisted. "It could blow up or something."
