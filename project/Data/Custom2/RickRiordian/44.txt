Amy hated crowds, but the idea of plunging into the middle of seven million
dead people didn't bother her.
Nellie, Dan, and she hurried down a metal staircase. They found themselves in a
limestone corridor with metal pipes running overhead and dim electric lights.
The warm air smelled of mildew and wet rock.
"Only one exit, guys," Nellie said nervously. "If we get caught down here -- "
"The tunnel should branch out soon," Amy said, trying to sound more confident
than she felt.
The stone walls were etched with graffiti. Some looked recent, some ancient.
One inscription was engraved on a marble slab right above their heads.
"Stop, mortals,"
Nellie translated.
"This is the empire of death."
"Cheerful," Dan muttered.
They kept walking. The floor under Amy's feet was slushy gravel. Amy was still
thinking about Uncle Alistair. Had he really known something about their 174
parents, or was he just manipulating them? She tried to put it out of her mind.
"Where are the bones?" Dan asked. Then they turned a corner into a large room
and Dan said, "Oh."
It was the creepiest place Amy had ever seen. Against the walls, human bones
were stacked like firewood from the floor to above Amy's head. The remains
were yellow and brown -- mostly leg bones, but skulls stared out here and there
like patches on a quilt. A line of skulls topped each stack.
