When Amy's eyes adjusted, she saw five figures in purple warm-up suits smiling
down at them, and one very excited pit bull.
"The Holts!" Dan said. "It figures. You helped Irina set us up!"
"Oh, get over it, runt," Madison called down. "We didn't set up anybody."
"Yeah," Reagan said. "You fell in all by yourselves."
She and Madison gave each other high fives and started laughing.
Amy's hands started to tremble. This was just like her nightmares ... stuck in a
pit, a crowd of people laughing at her. But this was real.
"So." Eisenhower Holt called down. "Is this what you brats were looking for? Is
this the Maze of Bones?"
Her heart fluttered. "What -- what do you mean?"
"Oh, come on, missy! We know all about the Maze of Bones. We read the
Almanack."
