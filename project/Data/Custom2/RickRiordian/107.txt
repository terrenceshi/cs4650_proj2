Hades wore black armor and a cloak the color of fresh blood. On top of his pale head was the helm of
darkness: a crown that radiated pure terror. It changed shape as I watched—from a dragon's head to a
circle of black flames to a wreath of human bones. But that wasn't the scary part. The helm reached into
my mind and ignited my worst nightmares, my most secret fears. I wanted to crawl into a hole and hide,
and I could tell the enemy army felt the same way. Only Kronos's power and authority kept his ranks
from fleeing.
Hades smiled coldly. "Hello, Father. You're looking . . . young."
"Hades," Kronos growled. "I hope you and the ladies have come to pledge your allegiance."
"I'm afraid not." Hades sighed. "My son here convinced me that perhaps I should prioritize my list of
enemies." He glanced at me with distaste. "As much as I dislike certain upstart demigods, it would not do
for Olympus to fall. I would miss bickering with my siblings. And if there is one thing we agree on—it is
that you were a TERRIBLE father."
"True," muttered Demeter. "No appreciation of agriculture."
"Mother!" Persephone complained.
Hades drew his sword, a double-edged Stygian blade etched with silver. "Now fight me! For today
the House of Hades will be called the saviors of Olympus."
"I don't have time for this," Kronos snarled.
He struck the ground with his scythe. A crack spread in both directions, circling the Empire State
Building. A wall of force shimmered along the fissure line, separating Kronos's vanguard, my friends,
and me from the bulk of the two armies.
"What's he doing?" I muttered.
