Michael just stared at the woman, and when neither of his friends
moved, either, she stopped rocking in her chair and leaned toward
them. “Gods above, you better get your rumps over here right quick
or there’ll be hell to pay, I can tell you that much. Now!”
Startled by her abrupt change, Michael scrambled to his feet,
Bryson and Sarah at his heels, and made his way to the center of the
platform to join the woman.
“Sit,” she commanded. Her wrinkled lips were puckered as if she
had no teeth, and her voice was scratchy.
They did as she said. Michael folded his legs beneath him and
waited intently. Stu like this was weird, he thought, but it wasn’t
that weird—he’d spent half his life inside the Sleep, and he’d gotten
used to strange characters like this appearing. Most of the time they
were harmless, but still, he reminded himself, if they had made it to
the Path, this lady might be linked to Kaine, and that spelled
trouble.
The woman peered down at the three of them, her eyes the only
thing about her that didn’t seem a hundred years old. They were
sharp and bright, but the rest of her looked used up and washed out.
Yellowed skin wrinkled and drooping from her frail bones. Wispy
gray hair that was barely there. Two ancient hands lay folded in her
lap, like gnarled tree roots twisted upon themselves.
“Where are we?” Sarah asked. “And who are you?”
The old woman’s eyes snapped into focus. “Who am I, you ask?
Where are you? What’s this place, what is here, why is this, and
how is that? Where’d we come from, and where will we be going?
Questions tumble out of your mouth, girl. But answers hide in the
mist of the clouds.”
The woman’s eyes wandered as she spoke, slowly drifting until
she was gazing at something far in the distance. Michael glanced
over at Bryson, who raised his eyebrows in a warning for Michael
to keep his mouth shut for a change.
“You,” the old woman said. One of her hands lifted from her lap,
shaking slightly, and a crooked nger pointed down at Michael.
