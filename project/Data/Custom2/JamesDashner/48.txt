“Don’t worry, I will.”

  A long pause followed, and Tick began to panic that Mothball would leave without telling him anything else. “So . . . what do I do? What are the messages for? Who is M.G.? What’s supposed to happen on the day he talked about in the first clue?” The questions poured out, even though he knew what her answer would be before she said it.

  “Sorry, can’t speak about it. Master’s orders.”

  Tick wanted to scream. “Well, then I guess there’s not much more for us to talk about, is there?”

  “Not much, you thought right there, little man.”

  Tick shivered, staring absently at the world of white surrounding them. “O . . . kay. So, what do we do now?”

  “Best be on me way, then.” Mothball bowed her head, as if she felt just as awkward as he did. A few seconds later she snapped her fingers and looked up. “Ah, me brain must’ve shut off there for a moment. I forgot something.” She pulled out a small writing pad and a pencil from her pocket. “What’s yer name—if you don’t mind me asking?”

  Her question surprised Tick. “You don’t know? How did you find me if—”

  “Just be needin’ to verify, I do.” She held her pencil at the ready, waiting for his answer.

  “Atticus Higginbottom. But everyone calls me Tick.”

  She scanned the pad with the tip of her pencil. “Ah, there you are.” She wrote a big checkmark where the pencil had stopped, then reached into a different pocket and pulled out a crumpled yellow envelope. She held it out for Tick. “’Ere ya go, little man. Congrats to ya on makin’ a very wise and brave choice not to burn the Master’s first letter. Now this should keep you occupied for a spell.”
