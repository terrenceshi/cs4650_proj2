“We don’t have time to explain,” the man said, his voice as strained as his face. “Just follow me and
run like your life depends on it. Because it does.”
With that the man made a few motions to his companions, then turned and ran out the big glass doors,
his gun held rigidly before him. Gunfire and cries of agony still rattled the chamber, but Thomas did his
best to ignore themand follow instructions.
“Go!” one of the rescuers—that was the only way Thomas could think of them—screamed from
behind.
After the briefest hesitation, the Gladers followed, almost stomping each other in their rush to get out of
the chamber, as far away from the Grievers and the Maze as possible. Thomas, his hand still gripping
Teresa’s, ran with them, bunched up in the back of the group. They had no choice but to leave Chuck’s
body behind.
Thomas felt no emotion—he was completely numb. He ran down a long hallway, into a dimly lit tunnel.
Up a winding flight of stairs. Everything was dark, smelled like electronics. Down another hallway. Up
more stairs. More hallways. Thomas wanted to ache for Chuck, get excited about their escape, rejoice that
Teresa was there with him. But he’d seen too much. There was only emptiness now. A void. He kept
going.
On they ran, some of the men and women leading fromahead, some yelling encouragement frombehind.
They reached another set of glass doors and went through theminto a massive downpour of rain, falling
froma black sky. Nothing was visible but dull sparkles flashing off the pounding sheets of water.
The leader didn’t stop moving until they reached a huge bus, its sides dented and scarred, most of the
windows webbed with cracks. Rain sluiced down it all, making Thomas imagine a huge beast cresting out
of the ocean.
