“She ate one slice of bread,” the ghost said. “Drank some river water. She screamed at her instructors in the
obstacle course, got put in a sack, John. A big burlap thing with a chain through it. Duct tape on her mouth. They
locked her in a small room with no windows for two hours.”
John sank to his knees, the phone pressed against his ear, his forehead bowing toward the pavement that smelled
of pigeon crap and rain.
“I can get to her anytime, John. Do anything I want.”
All his confidence drained away. Mallory was a little girl again, shivering in a huge black recliner, waiting for
him to rescue her, her eyes accusing him for being gone so long.
“Please,” he said. “Leave her alone.”
“You have your instructions, John. You're going to cooperate. You know it's for the best. That is what we all
want, isn't it? We all want a happy ending. Don't we?”
“My daughter—”
“She's asleep now. In a little cinder block cabin. She's shivering. No heat. She's hungry. They yell at her every
morning, noon, and night. If you had custody, you could sign your name to some papers and have her home. Or do
you want me to take care of her for you?”
“I'm online now.”
“That's good. The problem is, you used up your one call. Do what I told you. I'll be in touch. And John—you
don't have any leeway left. Understand me?”
The line went dead.
John looked up at the screen of his laptop—the screensaver etching orange curlicues in the darkness.
He thought of his father's eyes, as bright as shattered glass, staring out at the lights of Sausalito as if they were
patches of ship wreckage, burning on the Okinawan Sea.
