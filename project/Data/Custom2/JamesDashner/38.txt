And the headaches, the strange visions—just as Kaine said, he’d
been experiencing Decay. It had nothing to do with the KillSim
attack at the Black and Blue Club. Tangents could only last so long
before they began to break down. It also explained why his parents
and Helga had disappeared without explanation. He’d always been
told that was what happened—that elements of your life began to
vanish from the programming and you didn’t even realize it half the
time. At least, not at rst. He remembered the sinking feeling he’d
had when it hit him that his parents had been gone for weeks and it
hadn’t seemed strange until that moment.
Michael wasn’t real. He was fake. It sickened him. As if someone
had poured poison down his throat in big, choking mouthfuls. He
didn’t want to be alive anymore. He didn’t deserve to be. He was a
Tangent.
But Kaine had given him life. Had stolen a human body, made it
Michael’s. The Path had been a test—but one he wished now that he
hadn’t passed. Michael was nothing but a guinea pig for a Tangent
that had somehow become self-aware. And now he wanted him to
help make it happen again and again. Take over the entire human
race, maybe. It all t, and he understood why the VNS had wanted
to nd Kaine.
