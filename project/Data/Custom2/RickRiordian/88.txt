Ann traced her finger across the old eighth-grade class picture—the kids in colonial costume. Chadwick knew she
could name each child, their parents, their siblings. She could list the colleges they had gone to, and what jobs they
had now.
“I saw Norma this morning,” she said. “She warned me not to come. Said I was a stupid damned optimist.”
“My ex-wife. Always the diplomat.”
Outside, the dusk dissolved the trees and the sky. An instructor's whistle blew three sharp notes, signaling the end
of the tan levels' workday.
“And are you really happy here?” Ann asked. “Is this what you want to do?”
“Been a long time since I thought in those terms.”
Heat kindled in her eyes. “And why is that?”
“This is where I need to be.”
“Because you couldn't send Katherine here, so you had to come yourself?”
“Ann—”
“Katherine's suicide wasn't our fault, Chadwick. It's cost us so much time.”
“You sound like you blame her for dying.”
“I loved her, Chadwick, but not enough to give up our relationship. You shouldn't have left me. You shouldn't
have spent the last nine years punishing yourself, punishing me.”
“Was it my idea to put Race Montrose at Laurel Heights?”
“I didn't mean—”
“You called me—begged me to help, because you thought Mallory had been involved in the murder. Was that my
idea?”
Ann stood, as if she were about to yell at him.
Voices came from down the hallway—two people talking, a man and a woman. Counselors, Chadwick thought,
though he couldn't place names to the voices.
As they reached Chadwick's room, the man said, “I don't think he's here.”
There was a knock on the door.
