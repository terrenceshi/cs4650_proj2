As if the man’s opening statement wasn’t bizarre enough, the crowd
clapped and cheered after he said it, making Mark shiver. Bruce
waited for it to die down on its own before he spoke again. Mark
was anxious to hear what the guy would say next.
“Frank and Marla are back from a yby of the areas around
Asheville. Just as we thought, they’ve shored up those walls nice
and tight. Humanity and charity, my friends? Those days are long
gone. The PFC has created an army of monsters, people who used to
be willing to give the shirt o their backs for a neighbor in need.
No longer. Those scumbags in Alaska and North Carolina—our very
own Asheville—have turned their backs on the settlements once and
for all. Worse, they’ve turned their backs on us. Us!”
This elicited a chorus of angry shouts, stomping of feet and
banging on the armrests of the chairs. The noises echoed through
the room until Bruce started talking again.
“They sent us here!” he shouted. His voice was louder now. “They
assigned us to take part in the worst civil rights asco since the War
of 2020. A holocaust! But they were rm that it was for the survival
of the human race. They said it was to save what little resources we
have, to be able to feed those people they deemed worthy to live.
But who are they to decide who’s worthy?” He paused for a
moment before he continued. “Well, ladies and gentlemen, it seems
that we are not worthy. They sent us here to do their dirty work
and now they’ve decided to cut us o. Who are they, I ask all of
you!”
