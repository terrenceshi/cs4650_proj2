Chuck shrugged, then looked away, eyes rolling.
Thomas sighed in frustration and leaned back against the tree. “Looks like you barely know more than I

and some kind of meat cooking made his stomach grumble. Knowing now that it was just a sick kid doing
the screaming made Thomas feel better. Until he thought about what had caused it ...
