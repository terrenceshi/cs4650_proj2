Oh, Baby (hahaha)
Turn the mother fuckin' music up
When it comes to being true
At least true to me (that's right, it's what I do. C'mon.)
One thing I've found (uh-huh)
One thing I've found
Oh no, you'll Never Let Me Down (no, I ain't never let you down)
Down
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get uo I get Down
First I snatched the streets
Then I snatch the charts
First I had their ear
Now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I've Been Here From the start
I seen them put it together
Watched them take it apart
Seen the rovers roll up with ribbons
I've seen em re-poed, re-sold, and re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number 1 positions
When you hot, I'm hot
And when ya feet cold, mines are sizzlin
It's plain to see
Niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause Imma be that nigga for life
This is not an image
This is God given
This is hard livin mixed with Crystall sippin
It's the most consistent, Hov (in background)
Give you the most hits
You could fit inside a whole disk and,
Nigga I'm home on these charts
Ya'll niggas visitin
It's hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position
Holla at ya boy
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up
I get down for my grandfather
Who took my mamma
Made her sit in that seat
Where white folks aint want us to eat
At the tender age of 6
She was arrested for the sit-ins
And now with that in my blood
I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it
To ballets to choose leadership
But we can make it
To Jacobs and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music
And I just dont be feelin it.
Racisim's still alive
They just be concealing it
But I know they dont want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID
To get inside a Sam's Club
I done did dirt And when to church
To get my hands scrubbed
Swear I been baptised 'least 3 or 4 times
But in the land where
Niggas praise you, cons are gettin paid
Its gonna take a lot more
Than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more
Than Do-Rags to get you waves
Nothin as sad as the day
My girls father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey
I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you
For the way that she was brought up
And I know that you was smilin
When you seen the car I bought her
And you sent tears from heaven
When you seen my car got balled up
But, I can't complain
What the acccident did to my left eye
Cause look what the accident did to Left-Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels
Watchin me from the other side
When it comes to being true
At least true to me
One thing I've found
One thing I've found
Oh no, you'll Never Let Me Down
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trynna make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this, thats why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from him
So it's not me, it's he thats lyrical
I'm not a miracle
I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
Thats why I'm instrumental
Vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunte Kinte
I'm tryin to give us, us free like Cinque
I can't stop
That's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clenched on to your life in my grip
I would never, ever, let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed in the language called love
Thats why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color, and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth
A touch of God rains out.
Take 'em to church
When it comes to being true
At least true to me
One thing I've found
One thing I've found
Oh no, you'll Never Let Me Down
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get Down
Who else you know been hot this long,
(Oh Yeah, you know we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong,
(The ROC is in the building)
Built the ROC from a pebble, pedalled rock before I met you,
Pedalled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special,
Let you tell that man I'm falling,
Well somebody must've caught him,
Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them
Number one albums? What I got like four of them.
More of them on the way,
The Eight Wonder on the way,
Clear the way, I'm here to stay,
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that, dissin' Jay.
Dissin' Jay will get you mased.
When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious,
Six Hail Maries: please Father forgive us.
Young, the Archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas,
The way y'all all follow Jigga,
Hov's a living legend and I tell you why,
(Never let you down)
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov still alive.
Down... Down... Down...
