Ah, ah, ah, yo, I'm tryna catch the beat
Haha, haha, I wanna catch the beat
Haha, haha, I wanna catch the beat
Now, now, now, now, throw your muthaf- hands
Get 'em high, ah, say what, say what, come on
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high, let me see them hands up high
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high, get 'em high, get 'em high
And if you're losin' your high then smoke again
Keep 'em high
Ah, now now now now
Get 'em high like noon or the moon
Or a room filled with smoke, a hype-filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote
Control rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood
Should have my own reality show, called Soul Survivor
I stole on live-er niggas than you
You's a bitch, I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect
Re-re-re-re-resurrect, re-re-re-re-resurrect
I'm here to re-re-re-re-resurrect me
Re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-resurrect
Re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-resurrect
Re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-resurrect me
Re-re-re-re-re-re-
