“Carter,” Amos said, “the Egyptians would not have been
stupid enough to believe in imaginary gods. The beings they
described in their myths are very, very real. In the old days, the
priests of Egypt would call upon these gods to channel their
power and perform great feats. That is the origin of what we
now call magic. Like many things, magic was first invented by
the Egyptians. Each temple had a branch of magicians called
the House of Life. Their magicians were famed throughout the
ancient world.”
“And you’re an Egyptian magician.”
Amos nodded. “So was your father. You saw it for
yourself last night.”
I hesitated. It was hard to deny my dad had done some
weird stuff at the museum—some stuff that looked like magic.
“But he’s an archaeologist,” I said stubbornly.
“That’s his cover story. You’ll remember that he
specialized in translating ancient spells, which are very
difficult to understand unless you work magic yourself. Our
family, the Kane family, has been part of the House of Life
almost since the beginning. And your mother’s family is
almost as ancient.”
