The man who opened John Zedman's door had a pencil goatee, the build of a middleweight, and a Mexican snakeand-eagle tattoo on his forearm. He reminded Chadwick of Norma's cousins in L.A.—the ones who threw hand
grenades into empty police cars.
“You must be Pérez,” Chadwick said. “I've heard wonderful things.”
“Don't take warnings real well, Mr. Chadwick, do you?”
No hesitation. No confusion about who he was talking to. Pérez's eyes glowed like magnifying glass light on
kindling.
“This is Miss Jones, my partner,” Chadwick told him. “We want to speak with John.”
“You carrying?”
“We fly for a living,” Chadwick said. “Be a little hard to pack pistols.”
Pérez produced a nine-millimeter from the back of his belt. “I don't have that problem. Come on in.”
Chadwick glanced at Kindra. “Told you, you should've waited in the car.”
“After sitting on my butt an hour last time? Shit, Chad. Even this clown's more interesting.”
“I'm being hospitable,” Pérez warned. “So shut up and come in.”
All traces of Ann had vanished from the house. No orchids in the windows, no kentia palm under the skylight.
Her folk art no longer cluttered the coffee tables. The mantel was bare of photographs. Everything was stark white
and black and decidedly John.
Debussy on the stereo, postmodern paintings on the walls. The only sign Mallory had ever lived there was the old
kindergarten quilt hanging by the fireplace, its glass frame cracked, a huge triangular shard missing at about the
level of a man's fist.
Pérez stopped Chadwick by the sofa and turned him around, made him open his overcoat. Then he studied Jones,
who could've concealed six or seven weapons in her baggy flannel and corduroy layers.
