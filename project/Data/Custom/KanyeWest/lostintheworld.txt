I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
Down the time
I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a city
And I'm down for the night, down for the night
Says she's down for the night
I'm never alone
Down the time
I'm lost in the world
I'm down my whole life
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night
You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Mama say, mama say, mama Maku-san
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake-ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid in that afterlife
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid, yeah
I'm up in the woods
(Run from the lights, run from the night)
I'm down on my mind
(Run for your life)
I'm new in the city
(Down for the night, down for the night)
Down for the night
I'm lost in the world
I'm down my whole life
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
I'm lost in the world
I'm down my whole life
I'm new in the city
Down for the night, down for the night
I'm lost in the world
I'm down my whole life
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night
