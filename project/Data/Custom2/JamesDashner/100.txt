“Down at the bay, I ’spect. Keeping an eye on the ship’s loadin’. Asked me to fill in for him for a spell. So here I am, lookin’ at you fine folk, askin’

what you might be needin’.”

If Gloria was put out by the change in plan, she recovered quickly, motioning at Sera and her friends. “I rounded these troublemakers up for you

— they’re desperate for money, and I know you’re probably looking for some last-minute additions to the help.”

“Right we are,” he said quietly as he looked the three potential workers up and down. “Right we are. Can’t say as we’re all that picky, neither. You three willin’ to work yourselves to the bone? Sleep little, sit little, eat little, sick up that what you do? Get yelled at and kicked in the tush now and then?”

Sera wanted to say something contrary, but she couldn’t risk her voice giving her away. She nodded, and saw the others do it, too.

“Well, that’s good enough for the likes of me,” the man said with a chuckle that revealed several missing teeth. “And blessed be your little bottoms — I’ll be joinin’ you on this fair journey to the far reaches of the hungry sea. Hope you’re up for it.”

Gloria narrowed her eyes. “You’re going on the voyage, too? What are you doing on the ship?” she asked.

“Why, I’m the taskmaster, that’s me. In charge of all the lowly workin’

folk. The name’s not important.” He took a step forward and pulled up his bandana to reveal the hideous scar again. “They just call me Eyeball.”

DAK COULDN’T imagine a more perfect companion on his first voyage across the ocean than Eyeball. Quirky, crude, a vicious scar on his face — probably from a battle with pirates — what more could he ask for? And the taskmaster might be just the right man to seek help from as well. He’d be respected. He’d know everyone on board, and the ins and outs of how things worked.
