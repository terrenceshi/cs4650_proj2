“Only because I healed you, Isis!” Thoth said. “And yes,
Carter, Horus, whatever you call yourself, you were so mad,
you cut off her head. You were reckless, you see—about to
charge Set while you were still weak, and Isis tried to stop
you. That made you so angry you took your sword— Well, the
point is, you almost destroyed each other before you could
defeat Set. If you start another fight with the Red Lord,
beware. He will use chaos to turn you against each other.”
We’ll defeat him again, Isis promised. Thoth is just
jealous.
“Shut up,” Thoth and I said at the same time.
He looked at me with surprise. “So, Sadie…you are
trying to stay in control. It won’t last. You may be blood of the
pharaohs, but Isis is a deceptive, power-hungry—”
“I can contain her,” I said, and I had to use all my will to
keep Isis from blurting out a string of insults.
Thoth fingered the frets of his guitar. “Don’t be so sure.
Isis probably told you she helped defeat Set. Did she also tell
you she was the reason Set got out of control in the first place?
She exiled our first king.”
“You mean Ra?” Carter said. “Didn’t he get old and
decide to leave the earth?”
