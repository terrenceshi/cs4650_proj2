Michael closed his eyes and entered the realm of code
surrounding them. He poked and prodded, swam through the data.
He could sense Sarah’s digital presence doing the same. But the Path
here was even more strongly shielded than before. Michael tried
everything in his power to get to the code where Bryson was being
attacked, and he just couldn’t do it.
Sarah tried longer but couldn’t manage to get there, either.
“Thanks anyway,” she said softly.
Eyes open again, she and Michael avoided looking toward Bryson.
Michael didn’t want to take a chance of seeing what was inevitably
going to happen to him. But the sounds were bad enough. Growls
and ripping and tearing. Roars of anger, or maybe delight.
And of course, worst of all, Bryson’s screams. They tore through
the air over everything else and traveled down that long hallway as
if Bryson was standing right next to them. The cries were desperate,
so full of terror that Michael’s heart hurt, as if someone was
squeezing it with both sts. They’d signed up for this kind of life
inside the Sleep, but, real or not real, at the moment Bryson was
feeling every single bit of the torture being done to him.
Finally, mercifully, it stopped. And Michael didn’t need to look to
know that what was left of Bryson had disappeared, gone with the
last breath of his Aura’s life. Somewhere far away from them, their
friend was waking up inside his Con, probably still screaming
from the horror of it all.
Sarah grabbed Michael’s hand, squeezed it. And for the second
time in less than a day, he heard her crying.
