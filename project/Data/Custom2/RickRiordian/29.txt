A mile away in Copley Square, Irina Spasky -- code name Team Five -- was
worrying about her poison. She had loaded her fingernail injectors with the usual
mixture, but she feared it would not be enough for this meeting.
Back in the Cold War, she and her KGB colleagues used poison-injecting
umbrellas, or spray painted toxins on toilet seats. Those were the good old days!
Now Irina worked by herself, so she had to keep things simple. The needles
extended when she bent back her fingers at the first joint. They were almost
impossible to see and caused only a tiny pinprick sensation. The poison would
leave her victims very sick, perhaps paralyzed, for many days -- enough to give
Irina a good head start in the search. Best of all, the poison was completely
untraceable and had no antidote.
Unfortunately, it was slow-acting. Her victims might not show symptoms for
eight hours or more. If she needed to incapacitate her enemies quickly, she
would have to rely on other means
