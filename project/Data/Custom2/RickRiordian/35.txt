"Merci,
niece and nephew!" he shouted at the Kabras. "But your parents will be worried.
Run along now, and tell them I'll be out in a few moments. I have some
questions for this officer. I may have forgotten to declare my fresh fruits in
customs!"
"Fresh fruits?" the officer said. "Sir, that's very important. Come with me,
please!"
Alistair shrugged apologetically to the Kabras. "You must excuse me."
Ian's eyes were so angry they looked like they might catch fire, but he managed a
stiff smile. "Of course, Uncle. Don't worry. We will definitely catch you later.
Come, Natalie." He said her name through clenched teeth. "We have to talk."
"Ow!" She yelped as he gripped her arm, but he herded her down the hallway
and out of sight.
Alistair sighed with relief. He followed the gendarme gratefully back to customs,
where after twenty minutes of questions and searching bags, Alistair realized --
quelle surprise! -- he
did not have any fresh fruit in his luggage after all. He pretended to be a
confused old man, and the irritated customs official let him go.
Back in the terminal, Alistair allowed himself a smile. Ian and Natalie Kabra
may have been deadly opponents, but they were still children. Alistair would
never let himself be outfoxed by youngsters like them -- not when his own future
and the future of his branch were at stake.
