Meanwhile, Clarisse's chariots circled the drakon. Lances broke against the monster's skin. Skeletal
horses breathed fire and whinnied. Two more chariots overturned, but the warriors simply leaped to their
feet, drew their swords, and went to work. They hacked at chinks in the creature's scales. They dodged
poison spray like they'd been training for this all their lives, which of course they had.
No one could say the Ares campers weren't brave. Clarisse was right there in front, stabbing her spear
at the drakon's face, trying to put out its other eye. But as I watched, things started to go wrong. The
drakon snapped up one Ares camper in a gulp. It knocked aside another and sprayed poison on a third,
who retreated in a panic, his armor melting.
"We have to help," Annabeth said.
She was right. I'd just been standing there frozen in amazement. Mrs. O'Leary tried to get up but
yelped again. One of her paws was bleeding.
"Stay back, girl," I told her. "You've done enough already."
Annabeth and I jumped onto the monster's back and ran toward its head, trying to draw its attention
away from Clarisse.
Her cabinmates threw javelins, most of which broke, but some lodged in the monster's teeth. It
snapped its jaws together until its mouth was a mess of green blood, yellow foamy poison, and splintered
weapons.
"You can do it!" I screamed at Clarisse. "A child of Ares is destined to kill it!"
Through her war helmet, I could only see her eyes—but I could tell something was wrong. Her blue
eyes shone with fear. Clarisse never looked like that. And she didn't have blue eyes.
"ARES!" she shouted, in that strangely shrill voice. She leveled her spear and charged the drakon.
"No," I muttered. "WAIT!"
But the monster looked down at her—almost in contempt—and spit poison directly in her face.
