“She’ll be all right,” I told Carter. Then I shouted down to
the plaza: “Amos, come on! We’ve got to go!”
Desjardins kept backing up. I could tell he was scared of
the fire, but he wasn’t quite done with us. “You will be sorry
for this! You wish to play gods? Then you leave me no
choice.” Out of the Duat, he pulled a cluster of sticks. No, they
were arrows—about seven of them.
Amos looked at the arrows in horror. “You wouldn’t! No
Chief Lector would ever—”
“I summon Sekhmet!” Desjardins bellowed. He threw the
arrows into the air and they began to twirl, orbiting Amos.
Desjardins allowed himself a satisfied smile. He looked
straight at me. “You choose to place your faith in the gods?”
he called. “Then die by the hands of a god.”
He turned and ran. The pillar of fire picked up speed and
followed.
“Children, get out of here!” Amos yelled, encircled by the
arrows. “I’ll try to distract her!”
“Who?” I demanded. I knew I’d heard the name Sekhmet
before, but I’d heard a lot of Egyptian names. “Which one is
Sekhmet?”
Carter turned to me, and even with all we’d been through
over the last week, I had never seen him look so scared. “We
need to leave,” he said. “Now.”
