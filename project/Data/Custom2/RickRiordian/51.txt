Before she could finish, a column of flame erupted in her
face. I screamed, sure I’d done something horrible, but when
the fire died Zia was still there, looking astonished, her
eyebrows singed and her bangs smoldering.
“Oh, god,” I said. “Sorry, sorry. Do I die now?”
For three heartbeats, Zia stared at me.
“Now,” she announced. “I think you are ready to duel.”
We used another magic gateway, which Zia summoned right
on the library wall. We stepped into a circle of swirling sand
and popped out the other side, covered in dust and grit, in the
front of some ruins. The harsh sunlight almost blinded me.
“I hate portals,” Carter muttered, brushing the sand out of
his hair.
Then he looked around and his eyes widened. “This is
Luxor! That’s, like, hundreds of miles south of Cairo.”
I sighed. “And that amazes you after teleporting from
New York?”
He was too busy checking out our surroundings to
answer.
I suppose the ruins were all right, though once you’ve
seen one pile of crumbly Egyptian stuff, you’ve seen them all,
I say. We stood on a wide avenue flanked by human-headed
beasties, most of which were broken. The road went on behind
us as far as I could see, but in front of us it ended at a temple
much bigger than the one in the New York museum.
