Thomas’s heart sank in surrender. Everything seemed to indicate that he’d be getting a fist in the face.
“It wasn’t me, I swear,” he said, though as he stood there, he sized the boy up and realized he shouldn’t be
so terrified after all. Gally wasn’t that big—Thomas could actually take himif he had to.
“Wasn’t you?” Gally snarled. He ambled up to Thomas slowly and stopped right in front of him. “Then
how do you know there was something you didn’t do?”
Thomas didn’t say anything. He was definitely uncomfortable but not nearly as scared as a few
moments earlier.
“I’m not a dong, Greenie,” Gally spat. “I saw Chuck’s fat face in the window.” He pointed again, this
time right at Thomas’s chest. “But you better decide right quick who you want as your friends and
enemies, hear me? One more trick like that—I don’t care if it’s your sissy idea or not—there’ll be blood
spilled. You got that, Newbie?” But before Thomas could answer Gally’d already turned to walk away.
Thomas just wanted this episode over. “Sorry,” he muttered, wincing at how stupid it sounded.
“I know you,” Gally added without looking back. “I saw you in the Changing, and I’m gonna figure out
who you are.”
Thomas watched as the bully disappeared back into the Homestead. He couldn’t remember much, but
something told him he’d never disliked someone so strongly. He was surprised by how much he truly
hated the guy. He really, really hated him. He turned to see Chuck standing there, staring at the ground,
clearly embarassed. “Thanks a lot, buddy.”
“Sorry—if I’d known it was Gally, I never would’ve done it, I swear.”
Surprising himself, Thomas laughed. An hour ago, he’d thought he’d never hear such a sound come out
of his mouth again.
