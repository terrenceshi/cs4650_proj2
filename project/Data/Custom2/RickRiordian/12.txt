Annabeth flashed me an irritated look. "Your dad, actually. Don't you remember? Medusa
was Poseidon's girlfriend. They decided to meet in my mother's temple. That's why Athena turned
her into a monster. Medusa and her two sisters who had helped her get into the temple, they
became the three gorgons. That's why Medusa wanted to slice me up, but she wanted to preserve
you as a nice statue. She's still sweet on your dad. You probably reminded her of him."
My face was burning. "Oh, so now it's my fault we met Medusa."
Annabeth straightened. In a bad imitation of my voice, she said: "'It's just a photo, Annabeth.
What's the harm?'"
"Forget it," I said. "You're impossible."
"You're insufferable."
"You'reâ€”"
"Hey!" Grover interrupted. "You two are giving me a migraine, and satyrs don't even get
migraines. What are we going to do with the head?"
I stared at the thing. One little snake was hanging out of a hole in the plastic. The words
printed on the side of the bag said: WE APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS!
I was angry, not just with Annabeth or her mom, but with all the gods for this whole quest,
for getting us blown off the road and in two major fights the very first day out from camp. At this
rate, we'd never make it to L.A. alive, much less before the summer solstice.
What had Medusa said?
