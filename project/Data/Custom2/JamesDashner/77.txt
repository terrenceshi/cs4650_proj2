Two people jumped onto the rising ramp and started climbing
aboard. A man and a woman. Mark tensed his muscles and swung
his arm around, aiming for the man, but he missed and the guy
grabbed his shirt, then yanked his entire body forward. Mark lost
his grip on the ashlight, which went tumbling end over end
outside; a clang and the crack of glass signaled its demise. Mark
slammed onto the metal of the hatch and stared into the man’s face
—he had absolutely no expression, not even a sign of fatigue or
strain from the climb he’d just made.
“You’re a bloody spy,” the stranger said, as calmly as if they’d just
sat down for a cup of coee together. “And to make it worse, you’re
trying to steal our Berg. And strike three, you’re an ugly son of a
gun, aren’t you?”
“I was just going to say the same thing about you,” Mark replied.
Everything had turned surreal.
The man acted as if he hadn’t heard. “I’ve got him,” he called to
the other person. “Get inside, stop the door from closing.”
It registered with Mark who these two people were. The pilots.
He’d heard them speaking earlier.
“Sorry, man,” Mark said. The sense of surreality had turned into
an odd utter in his chest, making him feel almost outside himself.
His head thumped with pain. “I’m afraid I can’t let you on without
proper identication.”
The man looked a little taken aback. His partner was farther
away, right on the edge of the door, crawling to get in before it
closed. Something had snapped inside of Mark. He didn’t understand
what it was, but something felt dierent, and there was no way he
was going to let these people on board.
