"Ah, but you have something else, Percy. You have gifts you have only begun to know. The
oracles have foretold a great and terrible future for you, should you survive to manhood. Poseidon
would not have you die before your time. Therefore take these, and when you are in need, smash
a pearl at your feet."
"What will happen?"
"That," she said, "depends on the need. But remember: what belongs to the sea will always
return to the sea."
"What about the warning?"
Her eyes flickered with green light. "Go with what your heart tells you, or you will lose all.
Hades feeds on doubt and hopelessness. He will trick you if he can, make you mistrust your own
judgment. Once you are in his realm, he will never willingly let you leave. Keep faith. Good luck,
Percy Jackson."
She summoned her sea horse and rode toward the void.
"Wait!" I called. "At the river, you said not to trust the gifts. What gifts?"
"Good-bye, young hero," she called back, her voice fading into the depths. "You must listen
to your heart." She became a speck of glowing green, and then she was gone.
I wanted to follow her down into the darkness. I wanted to see the court of Poseidon. But I
looked up at the sunset darkening on the surface. My friends were waiting. We had so little
time....
I kicked upward toward the shore.
