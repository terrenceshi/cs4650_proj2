"Those weren't old ladies," Grover said. "Those were the Fates. Do you know what it
means—the fact they appeared in front of you? They only do that when you're about to ... when
someone's about to die."
"Whoa. You said 'you.'"
"No I didn't. I said 'someone.'"
"You meant 'you.' As in me."
"I meant you, like 'someone.' Not you, you."
"Boys!" my mom said.
She pulled the wheel hard to the right, and I got a glimpse of a figure she'd swerved to
avoid—a dark fluttering shape now lost behind us in the storm.
"What was that?" I asked.
"We're almost there," my mother said, ignoring my question. "Another mile. Please. Please.
Please."
I didn't know where there was, but I found myself leaning forward in the car, anticipating,
wanting us to arrive.
Outside, nothing but rain and darkness—the kind of empty countryside you get way out on
the tip of Long Island. I thought about Mrs. Dodds and the moment when she'd changed into the
thing with pointed teeth and leathery wings. My limbs went numb from delayed shock. She really
hadn't been human. She'd meant to kill me.
Then I thought about Mr. Brunner ... and the sword he had thrown me. Before I could ask
Grover about that, the hair rose on the back of my neck. There was a blinding flash, a jaw-rattling
boom!, and our car exploded.
