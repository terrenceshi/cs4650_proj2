Today he was taking his time, fingering his amulets and
considering his options. As the shabti approached, Walt
retreated. If Walt had a weakness, it was his cautiousness. He
liked to think a long time before he acted. In other words, he
was Sadie’s exact opposite.
[Don’t punch me, Sadie. It’s true!]
“C’mon, Walt,” Julian called. “Kill it already.”
“You’ve got this,” Alyssa said.
Walt reached for one of his rings. Then he stepped
backward and stumbled over the shards of Felix’s broken
shabti.
I shouted, “Look out!”
But Walt slipped and fell hard. His shabti opponent
rushed forward, slashing down with its sword.
I raced to help, but I was too far away. Walt’s hand was
already rising instinctively to block the strike. The enchanted
ceramic blade was almost as sharp as real metal. It should’ve
hurt Walt pretty badly, but he grabbed it, and the shabti froze.
Under Walt’s fingers, the blade turned gray and became
webbed with cracks. The gray spread like frost over the entire
warrior, and the shabti crumbled into a pile of dust.
Walt looked stunned. He opened his hand, which was
perfectly fine.
