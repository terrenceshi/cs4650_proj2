Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'd turn my life to Stephen King
Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like I'm on parole
I told her there's some things she
Don't need to know
She never let it go
Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Ok, Ok, Ok
You will never stop it now
You need to drop it
Now... drop it... drop it
Cause I don't want no Robocop
You moving like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop?
Now I don't need no Robocop
Just looking at your history
You like the girl from Misery
She said she ain't take
It to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it goin' on
I told her there's some things she
Don't need to know
She never let it go
Ok, ok, ok, ok
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Ok, ok, ok, ok
You will never stop it now
You need to drop it
Now... drop it... drop it
Cause I don't want no Robocop
You moving like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop
Somebody please make her stop
Stop... drop... roll... pop
Bitch I'm cold... I
Ain't used to being told stop
So I could never be your robot
Fast or slow you can stay or can go
Now, now that you know,
Now, now that you know
Yea I had her before but
That happened before
You get mad when you know so
Just don't ask me no more
Ok, ok, ok, uh, uh
It ain't ok, ok, ok
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just and LA girl
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl (you
Need to stop it now)
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl (you
Need to stop it now)
Oh you're kidding me
You must be joking
Or you are smoking
Oh oh you're kidding me
Oh you're kidding me
Ha ha that was a good one
Your first good one in a while
Your first good one in a while
You need to stop it now
You need to stop it now
Oh you need to stop it now
