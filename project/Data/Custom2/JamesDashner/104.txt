“Hey, no secrets,” Ricardo snapped. “Not a good way to start.”

Sera sat back. “Sorry. I was just making sure. This is a big deal.”

“I think it’s okay,” Dak said. “We don’t have much time — it’s supposed to happen soon.”

“What’s supposed to happen?” Francisco asked.

Daniel — the older man who looked lost in a world of his own —

suddenly laughed. “Sun’ll go down, I bet. Then the moon’ll come up.” He laughed again, this time with a snort.

“Oh, jeez,” Ricardo said, but his tone was more playful than annoyed or embarrassed. “Our friend is a lot smarter than he looks. Aren’t you, Daniel?”

“Two plus two is four,” the man responded. “Four plus four is eight. Take away the four times two and zero is your mate.”

“Huh?” Dak asked.

Sera liked the man. There was a twinkle in his eye that said he knew more than he was letting on — that maybe he didn’t know how to socialize and this was how he’d learned to make up for it.

“Anyway,” Ricardo said. “What were you getting at?”

Sera decided it was time to go for it. If they were going to do something about fixing this Break in history, they needed help and they needed to get started.

“You heard what the captain said,” she began. “That there’s rumor of a mutiny planned. Well, we actually already knew that and . . . we’re here to stop it.”

“How could you possibly know about it?” Ricardo asked. “Did someone send you?”

Sera hesitated. Telling the complete truth was not an option, but maybe she could avoid lying, too. “Exactly. We have friends in high places and they sent us here, secretly. I know it’d be impossible to prove everything to you, but we know exactly who is plotting against the captain.”

“Who?” Francisco asked, his eyes alit with interest.

“Would you rat brains shut up!” someone yelled from across the room.

“Sorry!” Sera answered.
