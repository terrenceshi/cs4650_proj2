He looked and saw a woman standing a few feet away. By the
shape of her body he could tell it was the lady who’d spoke to them
higher on the mountain.
Mark was incredulous at her lack of emotion. “So it was you who
left her. Why? And why are we prisoners now? We just want some
answers!”
Alec suddenly burst into a urry of movement, grabbing the rope
and pulling it as he leapt to his feet. It came loose from the men
holding it and Alec jumped at them, hurtling forward with his
shoulder out like a battering ram. He slammed into the side of one
of the men, tackling him to the ground. They landed with a heavy
thump and Alec punched away, landing a couple of shots before two
other men were on him, jerking him o the guy’s body. Another
one came in as well, and between the three of them they were able
to throw Alec on his back, pin his arms and legs down. The guy he’d
tackled scrambled to his feet and came at the old man, kicked him
in the ribs three times in a row.
“Stop it!” Mark yelled. “Stop it!”
He jerked on his own rope and started to get up, but the boot
came back, slamming him into the dirt once again.
“Do not, I repeat, do not move again,” his captor said, once more
using that at monotone.
