Long handwritten note
Deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean
When you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks
Your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
In dreams
I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake
In lonely beds
In different cities
And time
Is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
And darlin' they all look like me
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up
For the life of us we can't get back
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad
Beautiful tragic
Beautiful tragic
Beautiful
What we had a beautiful magic love there (uh-uh)
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
