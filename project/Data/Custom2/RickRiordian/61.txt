Someone was calling my name.
I looked back and saw Zia trying to sit up, clutching
weakly at her wand. “Sadie, what are you doing?”
All around us, the room was shaking. Cracks split the
walls, as if a giant were using the pyramid as a punching bag.
How long had I been in a trance? I wasn’t sure, but I was
out of time.
I closed my eyes and concentrated. The voice of Isis
spoke almost immediately: Do you see now? Do you
understand why I could not say more?
Anger built inside me, but I forced it down. We’ll talk
about that later. Right now, we have a god to defeat.
I pictured myself stepping forward, merging with the soul
of the goddess.
I’d shared power with Isis before, but this was different.
My resolve, my anger, even my grief gave me confidence. I
looked Isis straight in the eye (spiritually speaking), and we
understood one another.
I saw her entire history—her early days grasping for
power, using tricks and schemes to find the name of Ra. I saw
her wedding with Osiris, her hopes and dreams for a new
empire. Then I saw those dreams shattered by Set. I felt her
anger and bitterness, her fierce pride and protectiveness for her
young son, Horus. And I saw the pattern of her life repeating
itself over and over again through the ages, through a thousand
different hosts.
