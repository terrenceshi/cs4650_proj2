"We leave in the morning," her dad said. "If he hasn't made up his mind yet—"
"He's probably not coming," Rachel said miserably. "Happy?"
Mr. Dare put his hands behind his back. He paced the room with a stern expression. I imagined he did
that in the boardroom of his land development company and made his employees nervous.
"Are you still having bad dreams?" he asked. "Headaches?"
Rachel threw her darts on the floor. "I should never have told you about that."
"I'm your father," he said. "I'm worried about you."
"Worried about the family's reputation," Rachel muttered.
Her father didn't react—maybe because he'd heard that comment before, or maybe because it was
true.
"We could call Dr. Arkwright," he suggested. "He helped you get through the death of your hamster."
"I was six then," she said. "And no, Dad, I don't need a therapist. I just . . ." She shook her head
helplessly.
Her father stopped in front of the windows. He gazed at the New York skyline as if he owned it—
which wasn't true. He only owned part of it.
"It will be good for you to get away," he decided. "You've had some unhealthy influences."
"I'm not going to Clarion Ladies Academy," Rachel said. "And my friends are none of your
business."
Mr. Dare smiled, but it wasn't a warm smile. It was more like, Someday you'll realize how silly you
sound.
"Try to get some sleep," he urged. "We'll be at the beach by tomorrow night. It will be fun."
"Fun," Rachel repeated. "Lots of fun."
Her father exited the room. He left the door open behind him.
Rachel stared at the portrait of me. Then she walked to the easel next to it, which was covered in a
sheet.
