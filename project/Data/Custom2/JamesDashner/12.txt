Thomas watched as Alby unbuttoned the collar, then wrapped it around Ben’s neck; Ben finally looked up
just as the loop of leather snapped closed with a loud pop. Tears glistened in his eyes; dribbles of snot
oozed fromhis nostrils. The Gladers looked on, not a word fromany of them.
“Please, Alby,” Ben pleaded, his shaky voice so pathetic that Thomas couldn’t believe it was the same
guy who’d tried to bite his throat off the day before. “I swear I was just sick in the head from the
Changing. I never would’ve killed him—just lost my mind for a second. Please, Alby, please.”
Every word from the kid was like a fist punching Thomas in the gut, making him feel more guilty and
confused.
Alby didn’t respond to Ben; he pulled on the collar to make sure it was both firmly snapped and solidly
attached to the long pole. He walked past Ben and along the pole, picking it up off the ground as he slid its
length through his palm and fingers. When he reached the end, he gripped it tightly and turned to face the
crowd. Eyes bloodshot, face wrinkled in anger, breathing heavily—to Thomas, he suddenly looked evil.
And it was an odd sight on the other side: Ben, trembling, crying, a roughly cut collar of old leather
wrapped around his pale, scrawny neck, attached to a long pole that stretched from him to Alby, twenty
feet away. The shaft of aluminum bowed in the middle, but only a little. Even from where Thomas was
standing, it looked surprisingly strong.
Alby spoke in a loud, almost ceremonious voice, looking at no one and everyone at the same time. “Ben
of the Builders, you’ve been sentenced to Banishment for the attempted murder of Thomas the Newbie.
The Keepers have spoken, and their word ain’t changing. And you ain’t coming back. Ever.” A long
pause. “Keepers, take your place on the Banishment Pole.”
