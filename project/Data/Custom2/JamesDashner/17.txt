Alby had folded his arms, still glaring at the Box as if trying to open the doors with his mind. Thomas
hoped their leader didn’t bring up what he’d seen in the Changing—or anything related to Thomas, for that
matter. Especially now.
“Yeah, anyway,” Minho continued. “We found something weird.”
Thomas waited, hoping that Newt or Alby would have a positive reaction to the news, maybe even
have further information to shed light on the mystery.
Newt raised his eyebrows. “What?”
Minho took a full three minutes to explain, starting with the Griever they followed and ending with the
results of their rock-throwing experiment.
“Must lead to where the ... ya know ... Grievers live,” he said when finished.
“The Griever Hole,” Thomas added. All three of them looked at him, annoyed, as if he had no right to
speak. But for the first time, being treated like the Greenie didn’t bother himthat much.
“Gotta bloody see that for myself,” Newt said. Then murmured, “Hard to believe.” Thomas couldn’t
have agreed more.
“I don’t know what we can do,” Minho said. “Maybe we could build something to block off that
corridor.”
“No way,” Newt said. “Shuck things can climb the bloody walls, remember? Nothing we could build
would keep themout.”
But a commotion outside the Homestead shifted their attention away from the conversation. A group of
Gladers stood at the front door of the house, shouting to be heard over each other. Chuck was in the group,
and when he saw Thomas and the others he ran over, a look of excitement spread across his face.
