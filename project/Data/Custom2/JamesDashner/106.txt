Dak tried to clamp down on his panic. “Okay, Ricardo. Get out of here before they catch you. Sneak around and see if you can find us some weapons. Anything we can use to stop this from happening. Hide them where you can get to them later. Then you need to talk to every person you can trust

— anyone loyal to Columbus. You’ll have to use your judgment. Don’t give out too many specifics, just in case. But we need to act tonight, as soon as the crew is asleep. Have people ready.”

“At least now you know we were telling the truth,” Sera said to Ricardo.

“The Amancio brothers obviously want to silence us.”

The boy nodded. “I’ll do what I can up there. But what about you guys?”

Dak grinned — no one else knew about the discovery he’d made right before Ricardo had dropped in on them. “Don’t worry. We’ll be there to help.”

“Now go!” Sera yelled.

Ricardo ran to the ladder and shot up the rungs.

“That’s it?” Sera asked. “For the love of mincemeat, that’s your grand escape plan?”

“You got something better?” Dak pulled on the board again, felt it give an inch or so. It ran along the bottom of the wall between their cell and the one next to it, and if they could pull it all the way free, he thought maybe they’d be able to get another board loose, too. Just enough to crawl into the next cell

— which was unlocked.

“No, I don’t,” Sera responded as she gave the wood her own tug. “But this thing seems pretty solid, loose or not.”

“Let me try,” Riq said, already gently pushing Sera aside. “You kids don’t have fully developed muscles yet.”

Dak felt he had to say something back to preserve his dignity. “Well . . .

you don’t have a fully developed brain, so I guess we’re even.”
