Campers yelled and cheered as Annabeth and two of her siblings ran into the pavilion
carrying a silk banner. It was about ten feet long, glistening gray, with a painting of a barn owl
above an olive tree. From the opposite side of the pavilion, Clarisse and her buddies ran in with
another banner, of identical size, but gaudy red, painted with a bloody spear and a boar's head.
I turned to Luke and yelled over the noise, "Those are the flags?"
"Yeah."
"Ares and Athena always lead the teams?"
"Not always," he said. "But often."
"So, if another cabin captures one, what do you do— repaint the flag?"
He grinned. "You'll see. First we have to get one."
"Whose side are we on?"
He gave me a sly look, as if he knew something I didn't. The scar on his face made him look
almost evil in the torchlight. "We've made a temporary alliance with Athena. Tonight, we get the
flag from Ares. And you are going to help."
The teams were announced. Athena had made an alliance with Apollo and Hermes, the two
biggest cabins. Apparently, privileges had been traded—shower times, chore schedules, the best
slots for activities—in order to win support.
Ares had allied themselves with everybody else: Dionysus, Demeter, Aphrodite, and
Hephaestus. From what I'd seen, Dionysus's kids were actually good athletes, but there were only
two of them. Demeter's kids had the edge with nature skills and outdoor stuff but they weren't
very aggressive. Aphrodite's sons and daughters I wasn't too worried about. They mostly sat out
every activity and checked their reflections in the lake and did their hair and gossiped.
Hephaestus's kids weren't pretty, and there were only four of them, but they were big and burly
from working in the metal shop all day. They might be a problem. That, of course, left Ares's
cabin: a dozen of the biggest, ugliest, meanest kids on Long Island, or anywhere else on the
planet.
