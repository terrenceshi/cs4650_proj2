Two malls, each with thousands of stores, arcades, restaurants,
upload huts, entertainment bars, and anything else you could think
of, bordered a huge plaza that stretched for miles. Along it were
amazing fountains and air dancers and roller coasters, and Michael
had always been just as much of a sucker for it all as anyone else.
The whole place was designed for two things: to provide good times
and to drain people’s life savings. Things often cost as much in the
Sleep as they did in the Wake; the possibilities were just more vast.
Especially if you could code.
Sarah had to yank Bryson away—by the ear—about ve times
before they made it to the long, narrow alleyway they were looking
for. It branched o from the broad plaza and led to a section called
Shady Towne, where less mainstream aairs like digital-tattoo
parlors and pawnshops lined a cobblestone road that made Michael
feel like he’d traveled hundreds of years into the past. He even saw
a horse trot by.
“His place is right up here,” Sarah said, pointing.
No one had said much since exiting the plaza, and Michael knew
exactly why. There were a lot fewer people, which meant if
someone was looking, Michael and his friends would be easier to
spot. Michael put his faith in Bryson’s Tracer, trusting that they’d
know if Kaine slipped past their Hider programs and got close
again. Then they could nd a Portal and Lift to the Wake before
being dumped into that black abyss.
Cutter’s place was aptly named the Old Man’s Barbershop. It
didn’t take a genius to know that in a simulated world a person
didn’t need haircuts, but that wasn’t how most people rolled. The
more lifelike, the better. And eighty percent of those in the Sleep
had themselves programmed to grow hair. If you were skilled at
coding and really wanted a ponytail, you could just access the code
and quickly program it.
